(Maybe your name is here).  \tI really like these claims. Where did they come from? We hear, practically daily, that the NSA monitors, oh, everything. They can crack anything. they would never release a cryptosystem they could not crack.  \tWhere do people get these fascinating facts? \'The Puzzle Palace\'? If you can get it for a buck, 2nd hand, it must be true, eh? i am pretty sure the NSA is supposed to, among many other things, provide high-quality cryptosystems to a variety of places. I do not recall reading anywhere reliable that they are supposed to:  \t1) Monitor my phonecalls. \t2) Monitor usenet. \t3) Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack. \t4) etc etc.  \tThis is not to say that they *do not*, they might. But you do not know that they do, and you have no evidence that they do, for almost all values of you. It follows, therefore, that for most values of \'you\', your claims about the NSA border on paranoia.  \tAndrew
