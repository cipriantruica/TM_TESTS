However, an EISA SVGA card is likely a waste of money.  When XFree86 2.0 comes out, with support for accelerated chipsets, ISA, EISA, and VLB will all be supported.  The more important question is  what chipsets are supported? .  The bus is basically irrelevent as a compatibility issue.  -- David Wexelblat   (908) 957-5871  Fax: (908) 957-5627 AT&T Bell Laboratories, 200 Laurel Ave - 3F-428, Middletown, NJ  07748  XFree86 requests should be addressed to    Love is like oxygen.
