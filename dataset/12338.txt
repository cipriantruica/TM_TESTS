According to my physical electronics prof, you cannot get an LED with that band gap. that is why you do not find blue LEDs or, for that matter, some other colour of LEDs. That is not to say that blue LEDs cannot be found.  i have seen \'blue\' LEDs sold, but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering. They did not emit very much light...
