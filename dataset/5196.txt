From: kgrider@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Keith A Grider) Subject: Remote TEKTRONICS emulation  Hello,  I am looking for someone to help me with the proceedure for remote login, via modem not ethernet, to our new silicon graphics iris machines.  I can log in to them only as a vt100 terminal regardless of what I am emulating on my end.  I have communication software, kermit, which supports tek 401x and vt102 emulation.  The x windows manual lists XTERM as the appropriate command to change the terminal type.  When I try it the reponse is \'unable to open window\'  Thanx in advance  Keith Grider --  __________________________________________________________________________ Keith Grider\t\t        \t\'Come on man, let us go do the crimes kgrider@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu\tYeah, Lets get sushi, and not pay\' \t\t\t\t\t\tRepo Man
