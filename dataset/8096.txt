But by including countersteering : theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at : the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn. : And that was my original point.  : Mike   I am in complete concordance with you there, Mike.  I was a Silver StarRider instructor, for a while.  I learn\'t about countersteering last year and I have been riding bikes since 1976.  We were never told about countersteering when being taught to instruct.  It does not seem to have affected me or my friends or pupils.  We just rode in blissful ignorance. --  Nick (the Biker)   DoD 1069   Concise Oxford  M\'Lud.    ___\t___   ___   ___  { _ } { _ } { _ } { _ }\t  Nick Pettefar, Contractor@Large.   \' `\t` \'   \' `   ` \'\t\t  Currently incarcerated at BNR,   ___\t___   ___   ___\t\t  Maidenhead, The United Kingdom.  | _ | | _ | | _ | | _ |\t  npet@bnr.ca  \'86 BMW K100RS  Kay    ` \'\t\' `   ` \'   \' `\t\t  Pres.
