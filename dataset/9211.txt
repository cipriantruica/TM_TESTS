From: Ryan Robbins  Subject: Re: Game Length (was Re: Braves Update!!  Umpires are not required to call time out just because a player asks for time. Only in extreme cases, like dust in the pitcher is or hitter is eyes, should an umpire call time.  The batter has 20 seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch. i am against putting a giant clock (or any size clock for that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and the minute for warm-ups. But I think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, and instruct the pitcher to pitch. The same goes for pitchers. Umps should tell them to pitch or feint within 20 seconds or a ball will be called. that is the way it should be.   Ryan Robbins Penobscot Hall University of Maine  IO20456@Maine.Maine.Edu
