No. Do I think Clinton ordered it?  No. Do I think Clinton was aware of it before it went down?  No. Do I think Clinton was aware of it after it went down?  Of course; who was not? Do I think Clinton prejudged these people to a certain extent because he                    believed the BATF crap about child abuse and stockpiling                     evil semi-automatic weapons?   Yes. Do I think Clinton ever questioned federal jurisdiction in this matter?  No. Do I think Clinton ever considered the civil rights of the victims?  No.  > \tAs for the rest, I will not argue whether BATF handled the initial > confrontation well (or as it should have).

Some of us suspect that ALL the unlawful mistakes made on Day 1 were made  on the government is end.  That makes days 2-51 nothing but a macho  alternative to delivering an apology.  > As > for day 51, as long as the FBI and BATF did not INTENTIONALLY set the fire > then, while it is certainly tragic, the majority of Americans (according > to a recent poll) have no problems with the operation itself.   Who gives a good goddamn about some bullshit  opinion poll  of  most  Americans?   Most Americans swallow the government line that they are fed -- not because they are stupid, but because it is the only line they ever hear.   Most Americans  thought the staff at the McMaster(?) school was guilty, guilty, guilty.  Woops, turns out they were not.   Most Americans  once thought that black slaves were not human beings.  Woops, wrong again.  Most Americans  thought Saddam Hussein was the Antichrist.  Oh dear, he was a  special friend of the American government  until two years  previously.  You know, maybe truth ISN\'T determined by majority vote of a half-informed public after all.  > In fact, > most Americans (according to this poll) think it should have been > resolved sooner...  you are just testy because of all those newsbreaks that were interrupting  Roseanne.  --   cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\' Packet...
