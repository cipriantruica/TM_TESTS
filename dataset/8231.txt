When did *you* go out and change the laws of physics? :-)  According to some numbers I used to see bandied around, shaft drive is on the order of 95-97% efficient, while chain drive is closer to 99%...   Seems to me that this makes *chain* drive more efficient, hmmmmm???    And granted, shaft has a lot less maintenance, which is fine, if you do not mind less performance... :-) :-)  Randy Davis                            Email: randy@megatek.com ZX-11   Pilot                            {uunet!ucsd}!megatek!randy DoD            But, this one goes to *eleven*...  - Nigel Tufnel, _Spinal Tap_
