Julie, it does not necessarily follow that you should use it (MSG or something else for that matter) simply because you are not allergic to it. For example you might not be allergic to (animal) fats, and like their taste, yet it does not follow that you should be using them (regularly). MSG might have other bad (or good, I am not up on  knowledge of MSG) effects on your body in the long run, maybe that is reason enough not to use it.   Altho\' your example of the ulcer is funny, it is not an appropriate comparison at all.  -Prakash Das
