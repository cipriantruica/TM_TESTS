From: npratt@glacier.sim.es.com (Nevin Pratt) Subject: ** EPS CLIP ART ** 4Sale  Less than 1/2 of mailorder price!  I have three libraries, all on CD, which cost me over two thousand dollars mail order.  They are all genuine, high quality EPS vector graphics (NOT just some scans with a silly EPS wrapper!)  They are:  1. Totem Graphics color EPS library (about 1400 color EPS images).    This costs a thousand bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as    high quality (much better than Dynamic Graphics clip art, SOTMC clip art,    etc., in my opinion), but I rate both the 3G library and the C.A.R.    library as higher.  Totem is art is ALL color -- whereas most of the other is    are B&W.  it is the best all-color library out there, in my opinion.  2. C.A.R. Graphics library (have not counted how many images, but you can    purchase the library on 48 floppies, to give you an idea of the size).    This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as    very high quality, but it is only B&W.  3. 3G Graphics library (very popular in all the Mac mags).  This costs    about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as very high quality    (got some awards in one of the major Mac mags, forgot which).  Some of    the images are color, but most are B&W.  For what it is worth, all three of the CD is are saved in multiple file formats. They are readable on Mac is and PC is.  Additionally, Totem is will mount native- NeXT also, although the NeXT could just as easily mount either the Mac or PC filesystems.  i have personally tested the CD is on all three machines (i have owned all three machines, although I sold my NeXT a few months ago).  Also, in my opinion, the 3G and C.A.R. libraries are the best in the business (and i have seen lots).  Also, Totem is is, in my opinion, the best all-color library around, although I like 3G is color art better.  I want $850 for everything.  Can ship certified check C.O.D., as well as VISA/MC charge.  If you pay by VISA/MC, i shall ship pre-paid in the continental U.S. If I ship C.O.D., buyer pays freight and C.O.D. fee.  Reason for selling: No longer have DTP business.  Please respond via email or telephone, as I rarely check these news groups.  Nevin  email: npratt@glacier.sim.es.com voice: (h) 265-8949        (w) 582-5847 x6420
