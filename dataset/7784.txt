Whether you have ever attended a rally before or not This is the one    to make.  The only problem has been that there are so    many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.     Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.    For folks who have been to previous 49\'er rallies at Mariposa,     Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.    There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.    Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us.     Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early    arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays    for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday    with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the    awards ceremony.       For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on     registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course    be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider  and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15>.    and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.
