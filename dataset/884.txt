TTYL.  that is a typical claim, though they say they have improved compression speed considerably.  Did you find out anything else about the book?  i had be interested in looking at it if you could give me any pointers.  Reportedly, early fractal compression times of 24-100 hours used that marvelous piece of hardware called  grad students  to do the work.  Supposedly it is been automated since about 1988, but i am still waiting to be impressed.  Allen B (Sign me  Cynical )
