That was probably me. I meant only that nobody has overreacted yet.  It seemed to me that Jerry was suggesting that people are currently overreacting, and I  vehemently disagree.  I see a lot of talk, but not much action. I see now that I misunderstood Jerry is position.  > The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot?  > In a new Civil War?  > > Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and i am worried > that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens > and paper.

Look, we (collectively) have the power to throw the bums out, but we do not use it.  We clearly do not need to go burning things down, but we clearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out. Unfortunately, the bums have learned to target only small groups of people at a single time, so the masses will not react and throw them out. Eventually, the masses will react, unless the bums cease their relentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy. The sooner it happens, the less the damages will be.  I do not want to live in a war zone, either -- I want to see the bums thrown out before they do some *real* damage.
