I can think of worse things in the world.  Glad you got out of there >before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun.  If I hear someone screwing with my car (ie, setting off the alarm) and taunting me to come out, you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite will also be coming with me. it is not the screwing with the car that had get them shot, it is the potential physical danger. If they are taunting like that, it is very possible that they also intend to rob me and/or do other physically harmful things.  If they are just screwing around, no harm done. If they are bent on mayhem, they will receive the cure for their lead deficiency; a 180gr. injection   fps...there is no telling what today is violent criminals will do.
