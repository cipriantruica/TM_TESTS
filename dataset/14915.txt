And since the camera was not invented yet we can only guess what  he looked like. For example, with all the dinosaur bones we are digging up we still do not know if they were yellow-polka-dotted, or purplish-orange 8-). Likewise, I do not think anybody has a  picture of Jesus (is there ? 8-) ) So our current image of  Jesus is our best guess.  Okay. So let us assume that Jesus is black. Would that make you follow His techings ? Cause if you follow His teachings, skin  color becomes a moot point, anyway. What counts more in your life ? Your faith in Jesus or His skin color (as a human) ?  In the interest of historical accuracy, however, since Jesus was from Israel would not His skin color be like any other Jew ? i.e. fair-skinned ? Although probably heavily tanned from the desert sun ? Experts in this area speak up !!! cause i am not. 8-)    --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: My opinions.
