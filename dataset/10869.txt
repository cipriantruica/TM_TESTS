Hmmn.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYeah!  \tThe algorithm is classified because a military contract (or similar government equivalent to military) has been let for this  proprietary  design that the Feds say that NSA developed.  Is there a patent?  Is that patent publicly available?  My betting is that that too is classified.  \tIf the algorithm were made public, or reverse-engineered, it would compromise not only the goal of Justice of being able to read every chip users cypto-data but would reduce profits for the selected chip maker.  \twould not that just be too bad?  --  *********************************************************************** * Danny O\'Bedlam  = dfl@panix.com = cmcl2!panix!dfl = Danny Lieberman * * PO Box 3131 Church St Station, New Yawk, New Yawk, 10008-3131 (usa) * ***********************************************************************
