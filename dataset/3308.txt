From: spart@cs.uq.oz.au (Geoff Green) Subject: Multi I/O card with 16550 UART is  Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART is built in (rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)?  My current I/O card uses 8250 is (correct number? The braindead ones anyway). It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.  Ideally, i had like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with 16550 is and could also control another 2 IDE HD is. It would have to have configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so it could co-exist with my existing card.  Does such a beast exist? Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia, preferably Brisbane?  Thanks, Geoff Green (spart@cs.uq.oz.au)
