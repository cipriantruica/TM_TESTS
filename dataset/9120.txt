Funny.  I did not realize Mr. Tanner brought up Bob Knepper v. Pam Postema in the first place.  Thought it was someone named Jacobs.  >If someone posts something as controversial (not to mention >idiotic) as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup, >someone should challenge the statement.    Why?  If a statement is truly idiotic, and is universally thought so, the challenge is a waste of panting.  Further, challenges that have nothing (yes, nothing) to do with *baseball* are wasting others\' time.  You got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks?  let us hear it, in some sort of categorical manner.  (Actually, I question whether either Knepper or Postema are not  old news  at this point, although what I have read of Postema is book is interesting.)  >There is a school of thought that suggests that silence = consent.    I agree this far.  >Whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life, it certainly >SHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion...

But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read, >then I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal >to his drooling.  Yo.  Even elementary school children have had access to our postings, albeit in an edited form.  You want them to hear you talk like this? do not you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think you like to do the same?  Or do you want them to think you are some  politically correct demagogue who has oh-so sensitive?  (Ho-hum.)  Plus, you are here limiting free speech to  some obscure newsgroup that I do not read.   What BS.  You got a problem with what Jacobs says, what Knepper thinks, all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas, more and better speech.  Yours is the easy way out.  As for Knepper: ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of them?  You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that is not pre-prepared.  They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women, they pop some question about Postema.  (An interesting related question would  be whether the two ever appeared in the same game.  Off the top of my head, I guess  no.   If my guess is right, Knepper popped off about something that had nothing to do with him -- and Postema gets a book for it, and he does not.)  >Now, of course, you do not have to read any of this. >And if you want to cut down on flames, then DON\'T POST FLAMEBAIT! >(You do not have to respond to flames, either.
