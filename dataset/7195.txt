From: andrew@frip.WV.TEK.COM (Andrew Klossner) Subject: Re: Mercury Villager Minivan -- good buy?   \t The Villager-Quest seem like the best of the Cravan/Voyager \tcopies to come along since the Mazda MPV.   i shall agree about villager but not MPV -- it is so small that i had class it as a SUV with an extra seat shoehorned in.  To get any rear cargo space, you shove the back seat up against the middle seat, eliminating *all* leg room.  Back to the Villager ...  \t Only the price is controversial.   And the use of attack belts instead of 3-point belts.  That killed it for me.    -=- Andrew Klossner  (andrew@frip.wv.tek.com)
