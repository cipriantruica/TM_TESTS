As to the last comment, I certainly realize that it was not intended to sound that way.  I am still trying to understand *how* a spiritual being colud truly be one and three at the same time.  All of the descriptions of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading (sort of,  they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways, but really they are one, trust me ).  Neither of these is acceptible to me.  The fact is, so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any *sense* to me are the modalistic ones, such as Modalistic Monarchianism or  Economic Trinitarianism .  [I can accept that the three aspects are intrinsic to the nature of God, so I perhaps lean more towards the latter].  I am trying, here, to see if anybody can come up with another description that is both orthodox and believable.  --  sarima@teradata.com\t\t\t(formerly tdatirv!sarima)   or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com  [I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox, to the extent that well-meaning people think they have just flat-out confused.  there is no problem with things being both 3 and 1, e.g.  if the 3 are different parts of the 1.  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not exactly parts of God, because parts are things distinguished by physical separation.  All three Persons are omnipresent, so they are obviously are not physically separate.  But they are in some way different aspects, modes, or whatever, of one God.  If you accept economic trinitarianism, it is possible that you do not have any substantive difference with the standard view.  Is it possible that you just do not find the neo-Platonic explanation illuminating? --clh]
