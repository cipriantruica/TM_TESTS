The government decided to  discourage  them.  you are blowing smoke.  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas markets like Japan and the EC.  The government told them  do not do encryption if you ever hope to export this technology .  The reason that CDMA does not have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a\'knocking at Qualcomm is door. it is because Qualcomm does not think that the US market for digital cellular is big enough for them.  This is just the International Traffic in Arms Regulations all over again.  If you do not believe me, call Qualcomm and ASK THEM.  do not just throw out conspicracy theories.  At least, do not do it on sci.crypt--there are whole other newsgroups devoted to this kind of uninformed claptrap.  >any  normal  company trying to put one out will likely get a visit >from the boys in the dark suits from Washington, just like Qualcomm >did. I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because their >products are too expensive.  Hah.  they are not that much more expensive.  Besides, if a drug dealer can afford a Rolex and a Mercedes, he can darn well afford Cylink phones. No, Cylink sells their phones because they are willing to make different stuff for domestic use vs. export.  Qualcomm is not.  So Cylink makes money--that is capitalism, comrade.  >Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this.

If you think it is so easy, why are you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it?  Your name would become known and loved by dozens!  But no, that would require actual EFFORT.  \t\t\t\t\t-= Servalan =-
