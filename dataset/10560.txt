From: mblumens@itsmail1.hamilton.edu (Mary Blumenstock) Subject: FAQ for this group  Could someone please tell me how I can access the FAQ for this group?  i am relatively new, and would like to read it, but although i have seen it mentioned, i have yet to see it posted.  Is it archived somewhere or does someone post it to the group on a regular basis?  or, is it distributed on-demand?  i had appreciate any help anyone can give me.    Thanks in advance.  \t\t\t- Mary  p.s.  Please respond via email as the articles expire within 24 hours on my mail system, and I do not always get a chance to read everything.  Thanks.   =============================================================== Mary Blumenstock               mblumens@itsmail1.hamilton.edu                    GO RANGERS!!!!
