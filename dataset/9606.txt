Matt is problem is really more ability than attitude.  It is not that he has got it in his mind that he wants to swing away, but rather that he has (still) a total sucker for the curve ball.  It looked for a while in 1990 that he was getting better but it is still his weak point.  As to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him, the  net.stat.mavens will probably tell you there is no reason that it should, but if he thinks it will, it might be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  As to whether the Giants\' lineup is optimal:  who knows?  Batting Bonds, the team is best hitter, fifth does seem to be odd, but the   and   hitters are not exactly Messrs. OBA, so they are not giving much up there.  And although Clark is not the overall offensive force that Bonds is, he seems better suited to the   spot.  Assuming, of course, that he starts hitting one of these days...  --  |----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Michael Zimmers                                    |  Voice:  408 996 1965 | | SoftHelp -- Suppliers to Software Developers       |  Data:   408 996 1974 | |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
