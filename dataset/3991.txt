I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I  trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the  least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a  horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data  integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you  have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so do not place the drive on  it is side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a \'newer\' drive I  do not know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S  internal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it is \'newer\'.  -t
