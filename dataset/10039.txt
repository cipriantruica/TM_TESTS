There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a powerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines. Which would mean that Toronto is checking line would have to pull a triple shift. The Wings\' lines usually look like this:                         Gallant-Yzerman-Ciccarelli                         Kozlov-Fedorov-Drake                         Kennedy-Burr-Probert                         Ysebaert-Primeau-Sheppard   Oh by the way:  Start praying! : )   Laurie Marshall Wayne State University Detroit, Michigan Go Wings!!!!!
