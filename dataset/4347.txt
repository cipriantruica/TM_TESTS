Subject: Imagewriter II problem! From: Bliss B Siman   Urgent help needed. Daughter has SE 30 and Imagewriter II. Worked well until yesterday. Now when she tries to print from Macwrite II or Acta the printing message comes on, but not printing! Bought new cable, still no printing. Moved cable to modem port, still no printing! i am a DOS person and do not know where to begin. Are there diagnostics for a MAC?
