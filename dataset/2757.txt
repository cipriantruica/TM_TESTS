From: mancus@sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov (Keith Mancus) Subject: cannot get 1280x1024 to work w/2M ATI Ultra Pro    I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX2/66 to run Windows in 1280x1024.  I ordered a 2M ATI Ultra Pro, and i am pretty sure the 2M is really there because I *can* select 1024x768x65536.   But no matter what I do with the Flex program in the ATI is program group, 1280x1024 remains ghosted out. I have Windows 3.1, build 59 of the drivers, DOS 5.0.  The drivers were installed by Gateway, not by me, so perhaps there is a file missing from the hard drive.  It runs 1024x768 just fine.   I did go into the Desktop window and select 1280x1024.  Sometimes it refuses (ghosted out), other time it accepts it, but when I hit OK and re-enter Desktop, it is back to 1024x768.  At no time does it unghost 1280x1024 in the main Flex window.
