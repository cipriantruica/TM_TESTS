From: andy@ice.stx.com (Andy Moore) Subject: Q: How to avoid XOpenDisplay hang?  i am writing \'xwall\', a simple X version of \'wall\', and I want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays.  The problem is that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm (login screen).   i have been through the manuals and FAQ and do not see a simple way to see if a display is \'openable\' ahead of time, or to get XOpenDisplay to fail after a short period of time.  Any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info?  Thanks...  --  Andy Moore (andy@ice.stx.com) _______________________________________________________________________________  You could say i have lost faith in the politicians/  They all seem like game show hosts to me...           - Sting
