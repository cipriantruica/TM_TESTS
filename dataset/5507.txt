From: rrk@bones.et.byu.edu (Robin Kinzy) Subject: Resource listing for X11R5   Does anyone know of a source (book, file, etc.) of ALL the standard  resource names in X11R5? A small description of what the resource IS would also be helpful, but not vital. Any help in which direction to go would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
