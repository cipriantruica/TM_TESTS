First the    bus incident which I believe was in Canakkale three years ago, was done by a    mentally ill person who killed himself afterwards. The Pontus Greeks were ex-   changedwith Turks in Greece in 1923. I have to logout now since my Greek friend Yiorgos here wants to use the computer. Well, i shall be back.Asta la vista baby.
