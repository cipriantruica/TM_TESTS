From: tan@lynx.msc.cornell.edu.UUCP (David Tan,Box 219 Baker Lab,54810,2720402) Subject: Ignorant Imake/xfig question  Hi folks,  i am trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0, and i am having a little trouble with make/imake.  Specifically, make bombs when it needs to use any Xaw file.  This is not surprising since X11 files on Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under /usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!) Actually, the real problem is that I know squat about imake, and I do not know how to tell imake where the X11 files are.  I can see from the  Makefile that it is looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the  Makefile reads        Makefile generated by imake - do not edit!  Help!  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to look?  (I have set DEFINES = -DOPENWIN_BUG, as it said to in the README file.)  Email and post are both fine.  Thanks in advance,  Dave
