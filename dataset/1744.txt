From: rlafolle@apssgi.nswc.navy.mil (Robert D. LaFollette) Subject: Image format conversion tool   Hello,  \tDoes anyone know of an image format conversion tool that will convert a  raw (8 bit grey scale) image to Gif or Tif format.  It would be great if the tool ran on a PC, was a Windows application, and supported other formats, but i shall be  happy with anything that works.   \t\tAttn: Code L10MP   Robert LaFollette  \t\tDahlgren Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center \t\tDahlgren, VA 22448-5000  \t\t(703)663-4749   autovon 249-4749 \t\tFAX (703)663-4749 \t\tEmail   rlafoll@duchamp.nswc.navy.mil \t\t\trlafoll@128.38.158.43
