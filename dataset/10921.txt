(it is NIST, not NSA.  NSA is not supposed to have anything to do with this.) They did not say that.  They said is was better than some commercial-grade encryptions.  I, for one, would not trust them if they did, unless they release the algorithm for investigation.  >i had be happy to do so even with escrowed keys, provided I was happy about >the bona fides of the escrow agencies (the Federal Reserve would certainly >satisfy me, as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms).  Maybe the ACLU and EFF.
