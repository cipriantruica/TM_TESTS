While  most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD is who  are in  private practice  so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their  patients with Crohn is disease to RD is for dietary help.  If you can get  your friend is physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for  the RD is services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The  better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend is  plan does not, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to  control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal. Crohn is disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and  lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but  i am not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For  bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects  are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing  a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with  inflammatory diseases but it is not available yet.  Marty B.
