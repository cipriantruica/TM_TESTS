More detail in the next post. : >   Occam is Razor is not a law of nature, it is way of analyzing an argument, even so, it interesting how often it is cited here and to what end.  It seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being primitive, simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish, and yet again condemned as being too complex (Occam is razor), the scientific explanation of things being much more straightforeward and, apparently, simpler. Which is it to be - which is the  non-essential , and how do you know? Considering that even scientists do not fully comprehend science due to its complexity and diversity. Maybe William of Occam has performed a lobotomy, kept the frontal lobe and thrown everything else away ...  This is all very confusing, i am sure one of you will straighten me out tough.  Bill
