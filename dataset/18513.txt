From: clavazzi@nyx.cs.du.edu (The_Doge) Subject: What we learned from the Waco wackos   \tThere are actually a few important things we can glean from this mess: 1)\tWhen they start getting desperate for an answer to the question:  what is it all about. Mr. Natural? , pinkboys will buy darn near *anything*, which means: 2)\tthere is still plenty of $$$$ to be made in the False Jesus business by enterprising SubGenii.  Just remember that: 3)\tOnce you have separated the pinks from their green, do not blow it all on automatic weapons from Mexico.  Put it in a Swiss bank account.  Smile a lot.  Have your flunkies hand out flowers in airports.  The Con will just shrug you off as long as: 4)\tYou never, never, NEVER start to believe your own bulldada!  If  David Koresh  hand\'t started swallowing his own  apocalypso now  crap, he had be working crossword puzzles in the Bahamas today instead of contributing to the mulch layer in Waco.  This is because: 5)\tWhen you start shooting at cops, they are likely to shoot back.  And  most of \'em are better shots than you are.  \tIn short: \t- P.T. Barnum was right  \t\tand \t- Stupidity is self-correcting Thus endeth the lesson.  \t************************************************************ \t*  \tThe_Doge of South St. Louis\t\t\t   * \t*\t\tDobbs-Approved Media Conspirator(tm)\t   * \t*\t One Step Beyond   -- Sundays, 3 to 5 pm\t   * \t*\t\t88.1 FM\t\tSt. Louis Community Radio  * \t*   you shall pay to know what you *really* think!            * \t*\t\t\t-- J.R.
