You have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the Usenet groups: you are not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial enterprise (of _any_ kind; people frequently get flamed for announcing they have got a new book out.)  I do not know whether this is an official Usenet rule or just a long- standing custom, and it does not make much difference from a practical point of view.  So please do not do it again.  And all you others, who are even now taking keyboard in hand to flame him off the face of the earth--lay off.  He did not know any better. He does now.   Dorothy J.
