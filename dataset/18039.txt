Go back and read what I wrote.  The statement  homosexuality >spreads AIDS  is not made false by the fact that there are other >methods of spreading it as well.  But it IS made false by your ridiculous leap of logic from  monogamous homosexual male sex is so rare  (which is a load of horseshit--as proportionately many queers are monogamous as hets, and the ones who are not use condoms, for the most part) to  for practical purposes, homosexuality spreads AIDS.   No.  Unprotected sex with an infected partner spreads AIDS.  These  practical purposes  you speak of are obviously the purposes of spreading homophobia, which leads me to an interesting truth:  Cramer spreads hate.   is not that nice?  ># about what you are talking about, you would be dangerous.

You mean,  Typical homosexual response to Clayton E. Cramer.   I think any human being would react that way to someone as contemptibly hateful as you, actually.  I seem to hear the same sort of thing coming from your posts, you know....  >--  >Clayton E.
