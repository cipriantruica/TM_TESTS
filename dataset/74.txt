Craig-  I thought it was derived from a Greek acronym.  My Greek is not up to much, but it goes something like this:  \tJesus Christ, God => Iesus CHristos, THeos => Ichthos  which is the Greek for  fish  (as in, eg  ichthysaurus ).  Apologies for my dreadful Greek!  Perhaps someone will correct it.  By the way, what does your sig mean?  -Norman
