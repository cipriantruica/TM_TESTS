Have you checked: 1/ The setting of drive A: to 1.44 M floppy. \t\t\t\t\t\t2/ The setting of drive B: to 1.2 M foppy. \t\t\t\t\t\t3/ The cable connecting the two drives to \t\t\t\t\t\tthe controller card (I cannot remember which \t\t\t\t\t\ttwo wires are swapped, but they determine \t\t\t\t\t\twhich is drive A: & b:).  I hope this is of some help :-)   Steve  s872505@minyos.xx.oz.au
