From: schultz@schultz.kgn.ibm.com (Karl Schultz) Subject: Re: VESA standard VGA/SVGA programming???  |> 1. How VESA standard works?  Any documentation for VESA standard?  \tThe VESA standard can be requested from VESA: \tVESA \t2150 North First Street, Suite 440 \tSan Jose, CA 95131-2029  \tAsk for the VESA VBE and Super VGA Programming starndards.  VESA \talso defines local bus and other standards.  \tThe VESA standard only addresses ways in which an application \tcan find out info and capabilities of a specific super VGA \timplementation and to control the video mode selection \tand video memory access.  \tYou still have to set your own pixels.  |> 2.

Any advice, anyone?    \tVESA defines a  window  that is used to access video memory. \tThis window is anchored at the spot where you want to write, \tand then you can write as far as the window takes you (usually \t64K).  Windows have granularities, so you cannot just anchor  \tthem anywhere.  Also, some implementations allow two windows.  |> 3. My interest is in 640x480x256 mode.

There is a Set Display Start function \tthat might be useful for scrolling.  |>   Your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questions |> would be greatly appreciated.  Please send me mail.  \tYour best bet is to write VESA for the info.  There have also \tbeen announcements on this group of VESA software.  --  Karl Schultz                             schultz@vnet.ibm.com These statements or opinions are not necessarily those of IBM
