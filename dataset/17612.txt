The Bill of Rights, as far as I can see, does not once refer to  citizens , but it makes several references to  people . For example, Article IV:  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated ; Article V:  no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law ; Article VIII:  excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .  Now i have never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens; are not they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.? Whether slaves were considered  not human  I do not know, but it seems that a case could be made that they were not treated as  people  as defined in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the Declaration of Independence which states that  all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness , it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition of humanity.  ----- Eric Smith erics@netcom.com erics@infoserv.com CI$: 70262,3610
