Has anybody else noticed this also? I have the local bus card also, and do not have any such problems with it now, but this is the second card i have gotten - the first card did not work in VGA mode correctly.  Maybe they still have some quality control problems. I would suggest checking with ATI (I went through the vendor I bought the card from since the problem showed up immediately).  I never was able to get through to ATI is technical support number.    I sure like the way the card performs though.  I have the 2MB ATI ultra pro - local bus, and it is fast even in 1024x768x16bpp mode.
