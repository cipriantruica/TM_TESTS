From: neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org (Neal Howard) Subject: Re: Dogs vs. Bikes   My first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run. A big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes I was riding with and tried  to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. He kicked the dog a  couple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dog angrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then started after yours truly. At the time, I had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell) and as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike, I pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of the pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog is ears hurt like hell) and he did not come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either.   My second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. I was not paying  very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the carcass. I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I  just held onto the handlebars and freaked out. Both wheels went squarely over the dog is belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4 lumber. The bike did not lose any stability at all and I kept on going. After I got to my destination, I found bits of fur, meat, and blood stuck to the bottom of my motor and frame...... gross. --  ============================================================================= Neal Howard   \'91 XLH-1200      DoD        CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX) \t      doh     |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org \t      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac is.
