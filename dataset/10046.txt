The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year.  I had the Rangers on MSG, and the two different games on SCNY and SCA on at the same time.  Yes, i had rather have SC cover it, just for the amount of coverage.    |> Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!

I think Thorne earns his money.  The best part is that he is the same way when  he is earning his $$ from SportsChannel as the Devils announcer (i.e., unbiased).  He goes orgasmic for goals, despite which team scores, and even more  excited (if possible) for great saves.  He did a good job of explaining certain  things to non-hockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport (unlike NBC is clowns for the ASG).  -JPC  (Ob. Playoff-time flame-bait)        do not any of you Pittsburgh fans tell me how Mike Lang(e) is better.        Maybe if he were a little spontaneous, rather than reading rehearsed       lines of B.S having nothing to do with hockey he would be better.  --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P.
