From: mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) Subject: Re: ARSENOKOITAI: NT Meaning of  Meta-exegesis: Conviction of Sin,  part II  Let me return to the question, stipulating that Paul meant his use of _arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition of male-male sex.  In order to bring out the problems most clearly, i shall also stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the term for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would mean for Paul is readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter than my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us with some of the major divisions within Christ is body, and I am not trying to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that separate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely characterizable as  liberal ) will be evident, but I am not grinding an axe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD to reach  closure  when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we each, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.  So; stipulating Paul is intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS READERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is a second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?  Since Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st Corinthians, there are two  positive  answers and one  negative  to this question:  +\ta.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has \t    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem- \t    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be \t    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no \t    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence \t    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]  +\tb.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul, \t    what God means  behind  Paul is inspired word-choice.)  -\tc.  We *do not* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre- \t    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul, \t    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ ( those who have \t    more  -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is  obvious  from \t    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB \t    translates it as  grabbers ) or even _methusoi_ ( drunkards  \t    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult, \t    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)  The three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration for the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards tradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical demand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.  _ad_ a:\tIt is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the \tcommunity of Christ is disciples and their successors, and that \tour NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition. \tBut it is also the case that we know little or nothing about this \ttradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that \twe have access to the tradition only after several generations of \tpossibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only \tdocumentation of the tradition in the critical era.  _ad_ b:\tIf we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an \tattempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under- \tstanding the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of \tmen nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit \tfrom blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But \tthe downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit \tas our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that \ttakes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent \tunderstanding supposedly derived from the  clear  Word of God.  \t\t[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought \t\tconstrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even \t\twhile reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture; \t\tthe more bizarre forms of  I will read Scripture my way  \t\tare primarily a fringe aspect of  cultic  Protestantism.]  \tThe main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no \tmeans for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel \t*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible \tconflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind \t convinced  that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously \turge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian \tagainst Christian.  To what purpose?  _ad_ c:\tThe critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can \treach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open \tto all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually \tpossible. :-)  \t[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias; \tone complaint against critical methodology is that it  dissolves  \tfaith -- but surely a  faith  that cannot honestly face the evalu- \tation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to \taddress.]  Anyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between  liberal  and  conservative  positions, mostly on the basis of extreme zealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that despite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as ultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I predict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position its due, but no more than its due.   Second question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of  spiritual  Christians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible, that Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against male-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi- bility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it is precisely where inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they are most dangerous.  We have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of tradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them). We have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the traditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus and Peter and Paul do not so much  throw out  tradition as subject it to radical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:        the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Matthew 23:23) and   On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,       and the Prophets, also.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Matthew 22:40)  If there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the challenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation to go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts (vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus\' reported words and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination to *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges against are in fact open to challenge.  All traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may lead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual instruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and inherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is immune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy and good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from love of God and love of neighbor.  I am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That the Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am too dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I *know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians appealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated  sodomites  as the  cause  of the earthquake, so that legislation was passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in accord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human tradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much different in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick to condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit, then I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord is that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians, for the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.  And I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel said to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:  \t be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise, \tthis movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of \tits own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not \tonly be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves \tfighting against God.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t[Acts 5:36...39]   All I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures with a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our first Christian witnesses\' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER readings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and rabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of Christians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to judge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of the Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who are NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God is truth. --  Michael L. Siemon\t\tI say  You are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com\t\t\tMost High, all of you; nevertheless     - or -\t\t\tyou shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com\t\tlike any prince.    Psalm 82:6-7  [there is a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to whether you are speaking of tradition in Paul is time or ours.  I think there are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and his readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words in the context of that shared tradition.  that is what makes me think that these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that Paul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex. Everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background. The tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with that background.  Even if the words in the sin lists are not the most general terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there is some evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of homosexuality.  But when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that is rather a horse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a continuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition might be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul is original meaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted him, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition. A radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent. tradition to illuminate Paul is original meaning, but not use the Catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be.  --clh]
