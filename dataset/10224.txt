Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle, of the Blues.  They both sort of tripped and fell toward Malarchuk, and Tuttle is skate came perilously close to cutting (but actually just missed) the jugular.  Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice, hands at his neck, blood on the ice. > >Malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind Hasek, Puppa and Draper) after >suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.  he has been playing in San Diego >for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley.  he had been suffering from it for over a decade.  He just was not diagnosed for it until he did not sleep for ten days and decided to have some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he had just been put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  it is amazing he lasted as long as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between reality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they have checked is OK now.  For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands over and over and still think they are dirty.  He might check the oven ten times to be sure it is turned off.  He might see a movie about something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his own life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes, but still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD episode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt it slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).  In any event, he is alive and well and living in San Diego, while playing with the Gulls (IHL).    > >Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.  And Tuttle is no longer with the Blues, but I do not know where he is. Possibly in the IHL, but you had best ask a Blues fan.  --  Valerie Hammerl \t       John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab  hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside, V085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.   I wanted to learn how to  get that feeling, and the only way was to learn how to skate.   P. LaFontaine
