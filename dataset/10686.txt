From: cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com (Carl Ellison) Subject: Re: Clipper Crypto  I sent a response to the White House at  \t0005895485@MCIMAIL.COM (White House)  and received a nice, automatic reply from MICMAIL noting, in passing, that if I had included a SNail address, I would get a reply in due course.

I want freely to export uses of algorithms \t\t(like DES & RSA) which are already freely available in the \t\tdestination country  --   - >  - Carl Ellison                                        cme@sw.stratus.com  - Stratus Computer Inc.
