If I were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one resource called  accelerators  that took a translation table, period. I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified one, it would be active and automatically installed.  To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item i had do something like:  \t*menuItem.accelerators:    n  \t\tCtrlM:\tfire()  n  \t\tShiftL:\tfire()  n  The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a  Ctrl M  show up in your menuItem object.  Why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different special cases depending on what type of widget you are dealing with?  There has to be some reason.
