Are we paying for the birth or not, Mr. Parker?  If so, why cannot the  mother afford the pregnancy?  If not, what is the meaning of the  latter objection?  You cannot have it both ways.  Birth != pregnancy.  If they were the same, the topic of abortion would  hardly arise, would it, Mr. Skinner?  --  Frank O\'Dwyer                                  \'i am not hatching That\' odwyer@sse.ie                                  from  Hens ,  by Evelyn Conlon
