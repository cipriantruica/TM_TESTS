From: hlsw_ltd@uhura.cc.rochester.edu (Dave Hollinsworth) Subject: 2 questions about the Centris 650 is RAM  With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:  1.  What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)  2.  i have heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the C650 is RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)  Just wondering....  --  ***  Dave Hollinsworth  *********  hlsw_ltd@uhura.cc.rochester.edu   O      | | *  it is astounding;  time is fleeting;  madness takes   * PLAY      /       | | * its toll.  -- Riff Raff, Rocky Horror Picture Show    * PINBALL! /   -------| ***  DISCLAIMER:  they are my opinions.
