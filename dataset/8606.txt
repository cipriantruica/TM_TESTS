From: wba2320@ritvax.isc.rit.edu Subject: 1st time Biker iso ADVICE   i am just starting out with motorcycles,  i have read up on the subject a bit, talked to many of my friends who own/ride bikes and encourage me to do the same.  But when I ask about what kind of bike i should be looking at... i get varied answers.   i am 6\'3 , about 230#, large/athletic build...  I suppose that would help to determine the size bike i had want.  I want something that is going to be fast and powerful enough to satisfy certain cravings once i am used to it.  I also want something that is not going to be like a bronc my first time out.  Any ideas?!       Bill  replys are prefered through e-mail.  thanks in advance.
