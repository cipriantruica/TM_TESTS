What are your thoughts on it?  I bought a copy of The Satanic Verses when there was talk of the British Government banning it.  there is nothing interests me in a book more than making it illegal.  However, it is still sitting on my shelf unread.  Perhaps i shall get round to it soon.  i have still got a pile of Lem, Bulgakov and Zamyatin to go through; I do not find nearly enough time to read.  In fact, there are far more interesting things to do than I can ever find time for; how anyone ever manages to be bored is beyond me.  If I did not have to sleep, maybe I could manage it.   mathew --  Atheism: Anti-virus software for the mind.
