Pat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse.    Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  that is less than eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain and reschedule the EVA is in that time.  More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you have added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.   According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and AXAF.  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle, there does not seem to be any need for your vehicle.  --  Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu \t\t     Find a way or make one.  \t             -attributed to Hannibal
