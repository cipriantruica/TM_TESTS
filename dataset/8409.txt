If an engine is cylinder head design can benefit from this, then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires did not do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley Sportster 1200 and my best friend is 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who have tried them in 1340 Evo motors cannot tell any performance boost over plain plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead, i had dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head) --  ============================================================================= Neal Howard   \'91 XLH-1200      DoD        CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX) \t      doh     |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org \t      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac is.
