From: gt7122b@prism.gatech.edu (Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock) Subject: On Capital Punishment  In article   mmh@dcs.qmw.ac.uk (Matthew Huntbach) writes:  >I would say only to the extent that the Roman Catholic Church >neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment, as >confirmed in the recent catechism, though there are many RCs >who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was >not explicitly condemned.  I quote from the journal,  30 Days In the Church and In the World,  1992, No. 8/9, p. 29.   Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism:  \tIn procuring the common good of society the need could arise \tthat the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot \tcause harm.  By virtue of this, the right and obligation of  \tpublic authorities to punish with proportionate penalties, \tincluding the death penalty, is acknowledged.  For similar \treasons, legimate authorities have the right to impede \taggressors in society with the use of arms.  The Church is  \ttraditional teaching has always been expressed and will  \tcontinue to be expressed in the  \tconsideration of the real conditions of common good and the \teffective means for preserving public order and personal \tsafety.  To the degree that means other than the death \tpenalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the \tpeace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred \tbecause they are more in proportion and in keeping with the \tfinal goal of protection of peace and human dignity.    As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church is teaching on capital punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.    >I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken >as support for capital punishment. I take it that as a Roman >Catholic you are opposed to abortion, and would still onsider >it wrong, and something to be objected to even if legalised by > authority .  I seek to conform my will to the will of God as expounded by His instrument of the visible Church here on earth whenever the question of faith or morals arises.     --  Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock  Catechist gt7122b@prism.gatech.edu
