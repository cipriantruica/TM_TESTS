Something similar has happened to me - ages ago when we were working on PGP we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test  new features around.  Now at this time PGP (and certainly the newer version) was unknown over here.  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received a request that I stop sending encrypted email.  Now there is almost no way that some automatic scanner could have found this, since they would not have known about PGP - they *must* have checked for unknown data types in the message, tried to unscramble it, found they could not get past the PEM armour part, and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop.  Luckily the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their networks :-).  In case people think email scanning does not take place, I can assure you that it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by government agencies (or at least not that I know of), but by local administrators who, for reasons of their own, have decided to monitor all communications (i am sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/ terrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever).  There have been several occasions when i have got people into trouble simply by including the traditional NSA bait in a message (I do not try it any more now :-).  A friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of the UK town of Scunthorpe (hint: look for words embedded in it).  i am sure there are many more examples of this happening (in fact if anyone has any examples i had appreciate hearing from them - I could use them as ammunition during talks on privacy issues).
