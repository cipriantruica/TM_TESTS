From: lemay@netcom.com (Laura Lemay) Subject: Recommend me a PS printer    i am in the market for a laser printer. Used printers are fine, non-apple printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:  Required features:  - PostScript  - 300 dpi  - emough memory to download fonts  - The cheaper, the better.  i had prefer under $1000.   Nice things:  - anything over 4 pages per minute  - scsi output for a font disk  - smallish footprint    do not Care About:  - PostScript Level II  - networking (its just for me, and always will be)  - color   I know about Freedom of Press, but i have also heard that its painfully slow. I can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and i am not going to consider the price savings worth it.  i had be curious to hear people is experience with it, tho.   I also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in my last job and was not impressed with the quality.  i am a laser bigot and the first to admit it. :)   i shall be using the printer to layout pages of a book i am writing.  The page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality does not need to be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.   Printers i have been looking at:   - used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that   only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?  - Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee   discount (I work for one of Apple is spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably   cheaply.  i have heard bad things about the LS; comments?  i am leaning   towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.  - LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it does not have PostScript, but I have not   seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a  postscript upgrade.    ??  - Used HP LaserJets.  i have worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and   they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?  - i have seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.   Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),   but if its a decent printer i shall consider it.   Thanks for any comments...    --  ********************************************************* Laura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com writer of trifles in shadows and blood *********************************************************
