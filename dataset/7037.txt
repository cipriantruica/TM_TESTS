Any Opinions?    \tI just read articals on this in Road and Track and Car and Driver \t(Is that one mag or two? =B^), and I was wondering if people out \tthere have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to \tsay...   \ti am looking at the following three SUV is; anyone who has driven all \tthree have any strong opinions?   \tFord Explorer \tToyota 4Runner \tNissan Pathfinder   \tCurrently i am leaning toward the Toyota, because i have had big success \twith Toyota trucks in the past, and because I think it is the best \tlooking of the three. But I thought i had see if anyone has any strong  \topinions....    \t\t\tThanks!   \t-Karl     -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-   Karl Elvis MacRae\tSoftware Release Support\tCisco Systems   kmac@cisco.com -or- batman@cisco.com     415-688-8231   DoD# 1999  FJ1200   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- \t       Shovels and rakes and implements of destruction  \t\t\t\t\t\t-Arlo Guthrie
