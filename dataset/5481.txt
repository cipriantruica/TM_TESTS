From: naoumov@physics.unc.edu (Sergei Naoumov) Subject: TWM  Hey guys! I run twm and would like to execute some program before leaving twm. In other words I would like to run some program before I do f.quit. Is it possible to make a menu section which would contain these two parts?  Thanks in advance, \tSerge \tserge@gluttony.astro.unc.edu
