Well, of course I forgot about Microsoft is stupid arrangement when I got the  software, and used my name (it was paid for by the company i am doing  consulting for. When my job is done, it is their software).. Any ideas before I start doing dumb things to a copy of that file??  Mattias ps NO - I do not want to pirate this software. I just want to avoid having to buy a new copy in order to change the registration information and then having a copy lying around I do not use...  maybe I can get a new disk 1... --  Mattias Hembruch >> My views do not necessarily reflect those of the TSE. << E-mail: mhembruc@tse.com
