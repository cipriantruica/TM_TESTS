How about you read them in context, taking into consideration the times and  places in which they were written; the local customs and pagan rituals;  what the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with  the rest of the Bible.  There are many issues in the Bible that are argued, and can be argued  successfullly from both sides of an issue.  Some examples that come to mind are  \t\tGifts of the Spirit \t\twhen the Rapture will occur(pre or post tribulation) \t\thow people should be baptized to name a few.  I have found nothing in scripture that condemns me, or anyone else, for having a monogamous relationship with the person whom I love, even if we are the same sex.  i am sorry if I am coming across as heated.  it is just that the Lord has been so dear to me the last several years and i am tired of hearing this same old thing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for  themselves.  Check it out for yourself.  Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you.  If I were not confident of this I would not invite you to do this.  God Bless Loisc
