Geico has purchased radar guns in several states, I know they have done it here in CT.  I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped.  And once you have been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high risk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance.  My suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico!  Jeff
