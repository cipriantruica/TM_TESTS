From: umsmith@mcs.drexel.edu (Mathew Scott Smith) Subject: Axion Serial port switcher: Good or bad?  Hi!     i am looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has two serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)     Specifically, i am looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it seems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)     Does anyone know anything about it?  i have heard that with most of these things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you from physically swapping cables.  Although i have also heard that programs that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they want; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?     Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you are using something else that you think is good, i had be interested in hearing about other products.  I would like to spend under $140, if possible.     Please reply through mail; i am not a regular reader of this newsgroup. If there is interest, I can post a summary of replies.  Thanks a lot!  M. Scott Smith   (umsmith@mcs.drexel.edu)
