PostScript is a very big language and so the fig format can not be able to be an interpreter of ANY arbitrary ps code. The only program I know to manipulate PostScript files is IslandDraw. I for myself use xfig and include the PostScript files (converted to epsi format). Small changes then are possible (erasing some letters, adding text and so on). Reinhard
