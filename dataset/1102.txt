From: 235wardell@gw.wmich.edu Subject: VGA Passthrough Cables!   \tDoes anyone know the phone number to a place where i can get a VGA passthrough?  \tI want to hook up my VGA card to my XGA card (whcih you can can). All I need is the cable that connects them.  It is the same type of cable that you would connect from your VGA card to say a Video Blaster or something.  \tThanks. \t\t\t\t\t\t-Brad
