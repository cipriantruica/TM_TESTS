There would be no problems as long as the OS did not set up a DMA transfer to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably cannot be programmed that way anyways, so there probably isin\'t a problem with this)  Besides, like I said before, the FDD controller uses DMA channel   And I do not yet believe that the HDD controllers (any of them, MFM, RLL, etc) do not also use DMA.
