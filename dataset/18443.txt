[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints].  I do not usually read t.r.m.  It is truly informative to stop by, and see that there are still people in the world like those that forced my ancestors into the deserts of Utah, and then out of the country entirely.  (My grandmother was born in Mexico, where her family had moved to escape religious persecution in the US).  i am willing to admit that members of other churches are Christians, if they believe in Christ and (try to) follow his teachings, even though they have different interpretations of  the bible.  And yet these other churches often go out of their way to define whether or not I am considered to be Christian.  Could someone mail me a set of rules/beliefs that must be followed to be a Christian?  Does this set of rules exclude other large bodies of believers?    I know, this is a waste of everyone is time, this has probably been discussed N times, etc.  I guess i am more sensitive to this  hademonization\' after what went on in Texas. -- Don Corbitt, donc@microsoft.com Mail flames, post apologies.
