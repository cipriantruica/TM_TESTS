After all, Apple could have been smart and had AOCE use an MD5 hash  encrypted with RSA, just like PKCS signatures.  They could even be actually  PKCS compliant, for all you know; why not wait until it is released, and hard  information is available, before passing judgement on it?  AOCE is algorithm is are not secret because Apple is being fascistic--AOCE itself  remains secret (except for Apple demos at MacWorld :)), simply because it is  not done yet.  It may be flawed, and it may not.  However, you cannot tell which until you  actually see it.  I, at least, am quite impressed with what I have seen so  far, and have no expectation of being disappointed.   Amanda Walker InterCon Systems Corporation
