From: mfox@nyx.cs.du.edu (mark fox) Subject: Re: Battery storage -- why not charge and store dry?        Quite right, your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain most of their charge if drained and dried well, but i had throw out the electrolyte and buy some more when you need it.        And before anyone says i am wrong, remember that new batteries almost always come ready charged and dry, and they are perfectly OK even after several years\' storage at the shop.  Mark Fox
