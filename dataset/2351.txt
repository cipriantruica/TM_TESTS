From: tdarugar@cs.ucsd.edu (Tony Darugar) Subject: Fahrenheit 1280+ problems, help!   Hi,    I recently bought an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280+. it is a real nice card, but i am having very big problems with it.    The basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display in windows. Something like every other line or so. Also, when I use a DOS gif viewer, namely vpic 6.0c, in Fahrenheit 1280 mode, vertical lines are swapped. it is very strange looking. If it uses VESA standards, however, it works great! only it thinks there is only 512K on the card. (there is 1MB on there).    I have contacted Orchid support, and they tried to be helpful, but did not have the answer. I do not think the card is the problem, since it works great on my friend is computer.    Here is my setup: Fahrenheit 1280+, 1MB, bios 1.1 386-25, Opti-chipset2, AMI bios 1990, 5MB ram. Maxtor 120MB harddrive, (slave) Maxtor 40Mb harddrive (master) Panasonic c1381 monitor, version 4.6 windows drivers. windows 3.1 I tried taking all memory managers, etc off, and took all other cards (besides disk controller) off.    My friend is setup is 386sx-16, shamrock monitor.  If anyone has seen anything like this, or can otherwise help, I will be very greatful.  Please send e-mail to tdarugar@tartarus.ucsd.edu or \t\t\ttdarugar@ebon.ucsd.edu  Tony.
