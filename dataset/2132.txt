What I did: I installed DOS, Windows and CPBackup (functionally the same as your Norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the  DOS  backup  command on just that much.  To restore, I boot to the   system  diskette, and use DOS  restore  to read in that much, then boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB (Norton, in your case), overwriting what i have just restored.  That allows me to keep this skeletal Windows essentially unchanged, with all my customization on the  real  copy done using the 3rd-party backup utility.  >   2) i am wrong.

Seems possible, if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup utility on a  system  floppy.  Then you could restore it all on one  go .  --  = Martin Lodahl\t\tSystems Analyst, Capacity Planning, Pacific*Bell = = malodah@pacbell.com      Sacramento, CA USA\t            916.972.4821 = =    If it is good for ancient Druids runnin\' nekkid through the wuids,   = =  Drinkin\' strange fermented fluids, it is good enough for me!
