Vibration? BMW is do not vibrate. Everyone knows that.  i had agree with Henry.  The grips are really nice to have in winter, and are not noticably different from \'normal\' grips in summer.    My only complaint is that the \'low\' setting might as well be \'off\'. This has been complained about by every reviewer, official and unofficial, that is ever talked about these grips.  The \'high\' setting is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things just get a bit nippy, but since \'low\' does not produce a noticable effect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature about right.  This generally is not a problem when wearing thicker winter gloves.  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, I received a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for the poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they were suppose to).  Vibration?  what is that?  I ride a BMW twin.  You can barely tell if the engine is fired up or not most of the time, smoother than silk sheets.  -- Ken Wallich   ken@wallich.com ~ kmw@al.org ~ [...]decwrl!vixie!amber!ken
