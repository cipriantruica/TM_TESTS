From: Mark Woodruff  Subject: Many people on one machine  I have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separate environments under Windows for each of them.  Is there some way of setting things up separate desktops/directories for each of them?  Ideally, i had like totally separate virtual machines.  i had be willing to settle for less, and may end up having batch files that copy .ini files around depending on who wants to use the machine.  mark Alas, Setup/n does not work if you do not have a network.
