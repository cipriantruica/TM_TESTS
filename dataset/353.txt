The goals are probably not all that obvious.  We can set up a few goals, like happiness and liberty and the golden rule, etc.  But these goals are not inherent.  They have to be defined before an objective system is possible.  >How does omniscient map into  definitely  being able to assign > right  and  wrong  to actions?  It is not too difficult, one you have goals in mind, and absolute knoweldge of everyone is intent, etc.  >>Now you are letting an omniscient being give information to me.

Omniscience is fine, as long as information is not given away.  is not this the resolution of the free will problem?  An interactive omniscient being changes the situation.  >>Which type of morality are you talking about?

Well, I was speaking about an objective system in general.  I did not mention a specific goal, which would be necessary to determine the morality of an action.  keith
