I now know at least that though I may be on drugs, at least i am not the only one.  >The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but >it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie >grew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in >New Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the >strange constructions of Indian English: the  yaar  at the end of a >sentence,  Butbutbut,  the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)  Yes, this took some getting used to -- of course not having an Indian connection, no knowledge of hindi, etc., this was not trivial for me. I did have, thanks to the wonders of the net,  A Glossary to *Satanic Verses* , posted to rec.arts.books by Vijay Raghavan, which explains a lot of the Indian English constructions, Indian culture references, even the Islamic references ( Jahilia ,  Submission , the context of the Satanic Verses incident, etc.) -- what I have only covers the first couple of hundred pages, but it helped me get into the flow of the novel [I can mail this to anyone interested; if anyone has portions after part I, if they exist, i had like to get those]. --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.
