EDT   \t     Q\t  Mr. President, President Havel is here for the  Holocaust Museum opening, and you toured the museum last night.  All  this focus on the Holocaust, how does that weigh on your decision- making process as far as Bosnia is concerned? \t      \t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think the Holocaust is the most  extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing.  And I  think that even in its more limited manifestations, it is an idea that  should be opposed.  You could not help thinking about that.  that is  not to compare the two examples.  they are not identical; everyone  knows that.  But I think that the United States should always seek an  opportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against  inhumanity. \t      \t     Q\t  Sir, how close are you to a decision on more  sanctions on Bosnia? \t      \t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, of course, we have got the U.N.  vote.  Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the U.N. vote to  strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough.  And we now are  putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at  what other options we ought to consider.  And I do not have anything  else to say, except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on  it and will continue to over the next several days. \t      \t     Q\t  Following your meeting today, sir, are you any  closer to some sort of U.S. military presence there? \t      \t     THE PRESIDENT:  I have not made any decisions. \t                                       * * *                                \t      \t      \t     Q\t  President Clinton, why have you decided to meet  with Mr. Havel? \t      \t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, i am just honored that he would  come and see me.  i am glad he has here in the United States for the  dedication of the Holocaust Museum.  He is a figure widely admired in  our country and around the world, and a very important person in  Europe, and a very important person to the United States.  So i am  hoping that we will have a chance to talk about the new Czech republic  and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we  believe in.
