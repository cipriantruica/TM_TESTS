From: therzog@willamette.edu (Thomas A. Herzog) Subject: The 25MHz IIsi     So I finally decided to risk this upgrade, FAQ in hand i have gathered the pieces together.  The only problem is that I have not been able to find anyone who has even heard of thermal tape/glue (which is what the FAQ recommends for attaching the heat sink)  I am just tempted to use duct tape here.... anyone hae any ideas for me for attaching the heat sink to the processor??  much thanks.  tom -therzog@willamette.edu
