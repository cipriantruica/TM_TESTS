My impression -- it is not an area i have played with much -- is that the much-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete.  If you want to detect a 1kHz tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end.  The NE567 was what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays they are easy, and the results are better. --  All work is one man is work.             | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
