If you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed on during the drop, the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was intended to do.  Conservative rec.moto\'ers will recommend that you replace the helmet.  If you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately, you should.  \tHELMETS GO ON THE GROUND, ON A TABLE, ON A CHAIR, ON A SHELF, OR ON \tANY OTHER SURFACE THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY \tWILL NOT EASILY BE KNOCKED DOWN.  \tJeezus.  My new Shoei would be $340 to replace.  You think i am going to leave it to chance?  \tCripe.
