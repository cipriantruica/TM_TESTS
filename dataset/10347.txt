From: Mark D. Whitten  Subject: Re: If You Were Pat Burns ...  If I were Pat Burns i had throw in the towel. The wings dominated every aspect of the game.  Trying to mix up the lines is a dead end.  Murray has too many combinations to counter with. My prediction is wings in 5.  Mark let us Go Wings!!!
