It was decided to burn the place down, \tand more than one agent was dispatched to set the fires in \tseparate parts of the compound. I doubt that  simultaneously  \tmeans  at the exact same time  in this case. It likely means \t close enough together to preclude them from being part of \tthe same fire.    >The FBI claims that men with torches set the fires-- but have not released >any evidence of this, though it seems inconcievable that they do not have >any if it was true.  \tThey might be waiting until the evidence comes in from the \tsite, and the investigation is at least well underway.    >All of the BDs >previous actions were aimed towards their survival, not their death.  \tThe same could be said of Jonestown.  >The idea that kerosene lamps would be all over the place (with >electricity cut off) makes sense.

Then again, i have been suprised at what folks have missed \tin the past in similar situations. do not jump t oconclusions.                    _____  _____                         / ___/___________________   Mitchell S Todd      / /                 _____/__________________________ ________________      / / mst4298@zeus._____/.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'_\'_\'_/  _____         __    / / tamu.edu  _____/.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'.\'_\'_/      __________ __  / /        _____/_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_\'_/                  _ / /__________/                   /____/        \t\t\t        \t\t\t  ------
