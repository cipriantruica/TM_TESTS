I found that the controller could not keep up with a 1:1 interleave, so the best I could do with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec.  I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM, RLL, and IDE drives because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help needed from the computer is bios.  Dos will see many logical drives, much more than 4 (i have had up to 10).  i have often wondered how many SCSI drives you could hang off a ST-01/02.
