The Hirgun, and other branch -    off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of    Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of    terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the    Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British    soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in    favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  The Irgun killed SOLDIERS,  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted fogriend regime from a country.  They did not kill blindly their families or such (not as a policy,  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also were killed sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs.  In case I have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks of the Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  They even tried to justify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the army at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.     In addition, they    massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing    to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their    very lives.  Yes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes.  I was not there and do not have reffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away, most of the vilagers fled with several dozens,  most of them claimed to be fighters being killed.  Those  massaceres  are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not hounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period.  \t   I mention this not because i am anti semitic [i am part    Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the    Israelites pisses me off so.  i am not as critical of the    Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the    Jews.  It  is a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for    German and European anti semitism.  What do you mean  screwed over by the Jews ?  They began the \'47 war and did not accept the arrgenment planned by the U.N.,  what did you expect the Jews to do??  \t\t\t\t   Pissed off at Immature, \t\t\t     Closeminded, Self righteous \t\t\t\t   Semites                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Arabs are also Semites. -- --Amos Shapira (Jumper Extraordinaire) |   It is true that power corrupts, C.S.
