From: revpk@cellar.org (Brian \'Rev P-K\' Siano) Subject: Novell and Windows 3.1  \ti am working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell network (using shell version 3.22, I think). The workstation, a 386, was set up to run Windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. Needless to say, i had like to upgrade it to Windows 3.1, and have it work with the network.  \tBasically, the Windows files had be on the local hard drive, but several DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. i had mainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and perhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOS apps whose executables are on the network, that had be great, but I could live without it.  \tEventually, i had like to get a few other 486s in the office working with the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminals are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess that leaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there would be Norton desktop, but that is gettingahead of myself.  \tAs you can guess, i have never done anything like this before. i have read through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, i had like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area.  \tPlease reply by Email. I do not scan these newsgroups often.  \tThanks for any replies.   Brian  Rev.
