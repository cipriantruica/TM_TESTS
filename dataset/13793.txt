Not sure who captured it if possible..  I think it was one of the regulars who had most or all the data?  I think I started the latest round or the late last year round.. But the topic has been around here, off and on for a year or two..  == Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- i am not high, just jacked
