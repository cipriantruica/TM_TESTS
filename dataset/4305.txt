From: pedwards@csd.abdn.ac.uk (Pete Edwards x 2270) Subject: Centris 610 Font Problems  I recently got a Centris 610 4/230 on my desk. it is a vast improvement on my previous machine (a IIsi 5/40). However .....  i have encountered a problem with fonts ..  Entries in a Filemaker 2.0 database which looked fine when printed from my previous mac using System 7.01 now look wierd !  Spacing between characters has increased greatly - causing lines to be truncated. i am using plain and bold Helvetica in various sizes - the increase in character spacing seems to occur for all sizes and styles.   i am using a mixture of TrueType and Fixed-Size fonts - exactly as on my IIsi - when things worked perfectly.  we have managed to get similar behaviour using Word 5.1.  Apple UK adopted their usual  friendly  approach and told us to call our local dealer - God help us !!  Any ideas ??    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dr Pete Edwards  Department of Computing Science  King is College University of Aberdeen                  Tel.   +44 (0)224 272270/96 Aberdeen, AB9 2UE                       Fax    +44 (0)224 273422 SCOTLAND                                Email  pedwards@csd.abdn.ac.uk  ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS:  Pieces of plastic and metal, crudely fashioned to   bear a limited, superficial resemblance to real flowers, but with no   credible attempt to match their internal complexity in terms of form,   function, or behavior.
