From: 0005111312@mcimail.com (Peter Nesbitt) Subject: Newspapers censoring gun advertisements  Recently while looking around in Traders Sporting Goods store, a very well stocked firearms store, I discovered a printed document that was being  distributed by the good folks who work there.  Traders, BTW, is located in San Leandro, CA.  Granted, the document may be asking you and I to help out Traders, but in the big scope of things, I feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helping to this cause.  Anyway, here it is:  NEWSPAPER AD CENSORSHIP  Are you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life, what is good for you, what is not, and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their advertisments?  The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer see the ads that Traders, San Leandro, has run for many years.  These ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for sporting use or self-protection.  They certainly have the right to do so, under the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.  If you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to run legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your displeasure over their censorship doctrine.  Following is a list of Bay area newspapers who censor gun ads.  Perhaps you had like to send them your thoughts on this issue!  Oakland Tribune\t\tDaily Review\t\tAlameda Times-Star POB 28883\t\tPOB 5050\t\t1516 Oak St. Oakland, CA 94604\tHayward,94540\tAlameda, CA 94501  Argus\t\t\tTri Valley Herald\tSan Leandro Times 3850 Decoto Rd.\t\tPOB 10367\t\t161 W. Juana Ave. Fremont, CA 94555\tPleasanton, CA 94588\tSan Leandro, CA 94577  Contra Costa Times\tSan Mateo Times\t\tSan Francisco Chronicle POB 5088\t\tPOB 5400\t\t901 Mission St. Walnut Creek, CA 94596\tSan Mateo, CA 94402\tSan Francisco, CA 94103  San Fran. Independent\tSan Fran. Examiner\tSan Jose Mercury News 1201 Evans Ave\t\t110 5th St.\t\t750 Ridder Park Dr. San Fran., CA 94124\tSan Fran., CA 94103\tSan Jose, CA 95190  Then there are six pages of  facts .  I can not validate these facts, and  there were no sources, but many feel and sound very true.  Here are the topic headlines:  - Big Media Snow Job - Blaming Firearms for Murder is Like Blaming Hospitals for Death - I could use the same Nazi Journalistic Technique of CBS and ABC to prove   that Hospitals Cause Death - How NBC, CBS, and ABC have scammed the American people on  gun control  - American TV journalism is based on Nazi journalism - Why TV journalists lie - The Government with the help of the TV networks, has succeeded in playing   one group against the other - Gun laws are unconstitutional - American gun laws are based on Nazi gun laws - The Government is trying to devide and conquer - The CIA wants your firearms  and so on for six pages.  So now we have the media trying help put gun dealers out of business by trying to limit their exposure to potential customers, and preventing the customers from reading about sales of ammunition and firearms for sporting, hunting, or other recreational use.  Let me know if you write to any of these bozos.  /-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   | Peter D.
