Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect.  Nobody answered the   door, but his landlord gave us permission to search the apartment.   Perhaps that worked in California in the 60 is, but as I understand the law landlords do _not_ have authority to grant permission to search space rented by a third party, provided the lease is not in default, etc. (i am not even sure if they can provide the master key, when shown a search warrant, since the _subject_ of the search is supposed to be notified).  At this point the question becomes: did the user  rent  the disk space her encrypted file occupies?  If she did, it _should_ fall under the same body of case law that applies to apartments, storage lockers, etc.  (As to whether any court would recognize this fact....)  If she did not (i.e., no compensation exchanged), I do not know how it would be treated -- there does not seem to be a non-cyberspace equivalent.  --  Bear Giles bear@fsl.noaa.gov
