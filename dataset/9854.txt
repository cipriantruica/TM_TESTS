From: gld@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Gary L Dare) Subject: Aargh!  Great Hockey Coverage!! (Devils)   Locked away, waiting for the tape-delay to start ...  it is nice that the Devils are starting out their playoffs on network television ... too bad that their playoff game has been preempted on WABC-AM for an early-season Yankees baseball game!  it is a 12-2 win by the Texas Rangers ... and they are delaying the tape-delay by another half-hour for the ballgame  highlights !!!  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.
