Drag free may already have been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth is gravity field and ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag.
