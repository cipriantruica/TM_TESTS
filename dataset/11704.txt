The best info I have seen so far is the article  Joystick Metrics: Measuring physical properties through the PC is joystick port  by Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in BASIC, and even includes code for a simple  oscilloscope  display.  it is possible to read the joystick port directly if you do not want to use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some millisecond resolution timing functions, but that is a subject which has appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb is, Circuit Cellar Ink, etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.
