From: brians@atlastele.com (Brian Sheets) Subject: Constitutionality of 18 U.S.C 922(o)  You know, I was reading 18 U.S.C. 922 and something just did not make  sence and I was wondering if someone could help me out.  Say U.S.C. 922 :  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun.   Well I got to looking in my law dictionary and I found that a  person   might also be an artificial entity that is created by government  and has no rights under the federal constitution. So, what I  do not understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on  an individual. So someone tell me how my government can tell me what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a law  does not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitional until it goes to court. So, has it ever gone to court, not just your run of the mill  Ok I had it I am guilty, put me in jail   Has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told by the Supreme Court that they did not have that right?    --  Brian Sheets\t\t    _   /|  \t TRUCK?!
