Two things to watch for:    In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some    of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the    phone can be set to pulse dialing.    In Sweden, the \'0\' is the first digit and all other digits    are pushed  down  by one position; this makes dialing (and    in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.    Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign    phone to either the German or Swedish phone system.    OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course    illegal.  As the phone uses DTMF dialing, which by some magic all telecom operators seems to have agreed on, this is a complete non-issue.  I do not think there are any switches in Sweden that cannot handle DTMF dialing. Most switches are now digital and thoses that are not have been retrofitted with  magic fingers  that converts from DTMF to pulse dialing.
