From: scott@cs.uiuc.edu (Jay Scott) Subject: Centris 610 flaky?   A rep at the dealer (actually it is a university order center, so they do not have any immediate financial interest), told me that they have been having lots of problems with their Centris 610. He did not go into details, but mentioned problems with the floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files. It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems and software compatibility problems with the machine.  he has not recommending the Centris 610 to anybody; he says to consider a Centris 650 or a IIvx. (Why he would recommend a IIvx over an LCIII I do not know, but that is what he said.)  So, what does the net think? Did the dealer just get one flaky machine, or did Apple send the C610 out the door too early? Is your C610 working just great, or is it buggy too?  \tJay Scott \tscott@cs.uiuc.edu
