From: eshneken@ux4.cso.uiuc.edu (Edward A Shnekendorf) Subject: Zionism  The following flyer was distributed at AIPAC is 34th annual Policy Conference:  Because when we are not in Israel, we are told to go back where we came from and when we come back to Israel we are told to go back to where we came from and  when we are vocal we have too much influence and when we are quiet we can afford to be because we we control everything anyway and when we buy something we can afford to because Jews are so rich and when we do not buy something it is because we are cheap and because when we are poor we are called dirty Jew and ignorant and when we are not we are called called rich Jew and JAP and when we are visibly organized it is because there is a secret Jewish conspiracy and when we are not it is because there is a secret Jewish conspiracy and because we are told we are not a people and when we say we are we are still told that we are not and when we marry our own people we are called racist and we do not we are contaminating  someone else is  race  and because we are under fire from the Left and from the  Right and because there are whites who hate us for not being white and because there are non-whites who hate us for being white  and because anti-semitic  incidents are rising every year but we are told that anti-semitism does not  exist or that we are paranoid and because we are told to shut up about the  Holocaust and yet Holocaust revisionism is risng every year and when we are  obnoxious  we are called JAPs and when we are  nice  we are told we do not act Jewish and because anti-semitism is now world-wide and because our people is not yet free and because we do not have to complete the work but neither are we free to desist from it for these reasons and many many more we are part of the Jewish National Liberation Movement: ZIONISM.
