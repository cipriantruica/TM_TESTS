The first one i ordered Jan 15, and I received it Feb. 20. The second one I ordered Jan 20th, and I just got it April 2nd or so. Anyway, they both come with 10 misc. CDROMs... Things like a  Intro to Nautilis , a sample CD of Kodak pictures,  From Alice to Ocean  (a story of a woman who treked across Austrailia), 3 discs from apple, a games disc, an applications disc, and a  titles  disc (have not checked most of these out yet). Also some  Cinderella  thing for kids, a disc of Mozart something-or-others, etc. etc. etc. If someone is super interested, i shall make a list of the exact titles and post them. They are all in the category of  Interesting, but probably fairly useless... . It was rumored that the earliest  units shipped with SOME encyclocpedia (it may have), but neither of my drives had that.  -jeff adams-
