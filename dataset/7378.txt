From: bz754@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Derek J. Wojciech) Subject: Question to Nissan 300ZX owners/gurus (esp 87-89 models)   I purchased a used 1988 Nissan 300ZX (non-turbo) last year.  I had a  question on gear/rpm ratios.  Right now in 5th   i am at  2600-2700 rpms.    i am at about 2900rpms.  Is this about the norm?  i am an auto neophyte so i am just wondering if these are the proper ranges?  Somehow the rpm figures seem high.  A friend of mine just told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 Chevy Beretta (2.8l V6.) Also, anyone know the top speed attainable (@redline???) for this model Z? (Not that I would try it but it would be an interesting factoid. :)   \t\t\t\tThanx! \t\t\t\t\tDerek   --  \'Fire and Love, the two extremes |  wojciech@ossek.nrl.navy.mil /    ***. that we live between, Fire and   |-----------------------------/    **   \' Love, there is more to life than  | Surfing or Snowboarding         **** the eye can see.\'  Guardian      |      ridin\' the Wave........._-*********
