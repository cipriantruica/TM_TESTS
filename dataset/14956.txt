If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what \t. \t. \t.  Why do you assume that Jesus is plea to His Father  to let this cup pass from Him , was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the presense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His presense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it was brought more and more to Jesus is attention (the betrayal of Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not only then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of Jesus is suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg.  BTW, we know from John is account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly king.  From John:  JOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they             began to say,  Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the             world.  JOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by             force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.  This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew & Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus is dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew what His Father is will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of His Passion.  --  John G.
