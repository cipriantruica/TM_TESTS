Toronto, to the Cup finals???  First of all, has anyone on the planet heard of the team from Detroit?  Al Morgani (or however you spell the idiot is name) must be from Chicago, because on ESPN, he said  it is not even close--Chicago will definatly win the Norris Division in the Playoffs, no other team is close.   Everyone is picking Chicago!  I do not get it, he says it is an  easy choice ? God, Chicago was 1-4-1 against the Wings, and they won the division by a point or two, followed closely by Toronto, who is also a good team! As for the Leafs beating Detroit--doubt it, but even if they do, they are not going to get by Chicago.  If (even more amazingly) they get past the Hawks, they would probably face Vancouver, and lose. As for The Habs reaching the Finals, forget it.  Even I, as a devoted Wings fan, will watch the Penguins easily three-peat as Cup winners.  Lemieux, Jagr, Tocchet, Stevens, and Barrasso, its a done deal.  Sorry Detroit, wait til next year. But hey, these were Paul is picks, and everyone has a right to their own opinnions, but the Leafs to the Finals??? Yeah. If they make it there, i shall walk to Toronto to get some tickets, and that is a 700 mile walk!    --Ryan--  Detroit Red Wings--the forgotten team!  Go Wings!!  let us hope the Penguins go out early!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
