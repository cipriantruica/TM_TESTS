Thanks.   \ti have read mixed opinions on this.  Singed meat can contain carcinogens, but unless you eat barbecued meat every meal, you are probably not at much risk.  I think I will live life on the edge and grill my food.  \ti have also read that using petroleum based charcoal starter can put some unwanted toxins in your food, or at least unwanted odor. i have been using egg carton cups dipped in paraffin for fire starters, and it actually lights faster and easier than lighter fluid.  Several people have told me that they have excellent results with a chimney, basically a steel cylinder with wholes punched in the side.  i have been meaning to get one of these, but one has not presented itself while i have been out shopping.  You can make one from a coffee can, but I buy my coffee as whole beans in a bag, so I have not had a big enough can laying around. -- Jason C. Austin j.c.austin@larc.nasa.gov
