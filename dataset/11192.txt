From: throopw%sheol@concert.net Subject: Re: Clipper considered harmful  : From: shirriff@sprite.berkeley.edu (Ken Shirriff) : Message-ID:  : It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications : would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future : probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy would not get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  i had be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that does not mean I think it will not be done if technically feasible.  Just as i am sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, will not ever be presented to a jury.  While i am posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read  Lacey and his Friends , a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But do not worry folks, it is stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we will be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, do not we?  And then we will pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we will make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there is still a right to privacy.  We have not curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it had be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you are not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this did not elminate all crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of competition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.   I cannot imagine why.  -- Wayne Throop   throopw%sheol@concert.net                throop%aurgate@concert.net
