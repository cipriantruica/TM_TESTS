Where the hell did you come up with that? The Orioles are not a base-stealing team except for Anderson. Besides we would never call them anything but the Baltimore Orioles. Why? The ballpark has all these orthologically (spelling error?) correct BALTIMORE ORIOLES all over the place. I bet you thought the bird is just an oriole. it is not. The bird was named after Lord Baltimore when Maryland was founded. they are called Baltimore Orioles. But the post is just a joke so why do I care what a non-O is fan thinks of us? But I still wonder where Baseblazers came from. San Diego Padres, now there is a name that needs to be changed. How is padre being used? As  Father  ie priest or  father  ie parents?  ____________________________________________________________________________ |Admiral Steve C.
