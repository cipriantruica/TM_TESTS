From: uchima@fncrdh.fnal.gov (Mike Uchima) Subject: Re: G2K/Jumbo 250 Backup Problems  I have been told by several people that Sony data cartridges do not quite cut it in the Jumbo 250 tape drive (lots of bad blocks).  If you are using Sony tape, try switching to something else -- like maybe 3M.  -- Mike
