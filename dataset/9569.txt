From: behrens@cc.swarthmore.edu (Eric Behrens) Subject: The Babe v. The Pride of the Yankees   The Babe and The Pride of the Yankees offer very different renditions of the sotry about Ruth and Gherig hitting home runs for the boy in the hospital.  Can some historian out there explain  history is  version of the story.    I would not put is past either (or both) of the movies to season the truth with a little extra spice.  Any other comments as to inaccuracies in these two movies?    ------------------------------  Eric A. W.
