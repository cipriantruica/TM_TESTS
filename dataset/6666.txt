Any advice on HOW to buy a Land Cruiser? My local Toyota dealer says they get two a year, and if I want one I can just get on the waiting list. Forget about a test drive or even kicking the tires. And if they are that rare, I doubt there is much of a parts inventory on hand.    --  Jonathan Edwards\t\t\t\tedwards@intranet.com IntraNet, Inc\t\t\t\t\t617-527-7020
