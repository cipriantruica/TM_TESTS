Once you have found a bike you are interested in, call some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; i am 27) > >3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?  For a first bike, I recommend 500cc is or less. And a bike short enough to get both feet on the ground when you stop.   The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety Foundation Rider is Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you to ride properly from the beginning, so you will not learn any bad habits.  Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.  Alan
