From: mek@hydrox.enet.dec.com (Mark Klamerus) Subject: re: TIFF complexity   \tAnyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex has not dealt with \tCGM, ASN.1, CDA, DCA, SGML, or any one of a number of other \tvery successful file format.  People seem perfectly capable \tdealing with these others.  Dealing with the format of TIFF \tis frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and \tFAX encoding of the image data.  The majority of the libraries \twhich deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather \tthan with simply decoding the tags and parameters.  \tPerhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather \tsimpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest \tthat TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.  \tThat does not mean that GIF is not fine, but do not even thing about \tusing it in many instances.  GIF is very nice for use in low-end \tphotos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would \tnever do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice, \tbut it does not do color (and GIF does not do B&W all that well). \tJPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.  \tThe advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle \tall these situations (and then some).  Naturally it is more complex. \tBut I\'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging \tsystems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.  \tYou may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes \tbut please do not wrail against it is complexity.  The complexity \tit contains is required to provide the functionality it does and \tdoes not come close to the complexity found in most commercially \tviable file formats.   \tIf we are in philosophical arguments against complexity, let us all \tgo program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length \tencoding.
