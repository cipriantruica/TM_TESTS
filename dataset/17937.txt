Be careful here...the problem is not the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich rich.  Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system and make money, everything ELSE we care about goes to shit.  I have to constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make money.  Money does not make us happy; it just prevents certain things making us more unhappy.  Therefore, do not shoot the rich.  Shoot the conservatives!  Drewcifer --  ----bi    Andrew D.
