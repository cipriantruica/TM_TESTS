Both machines were running System7.1, had a 14  RGB.  do not know what the caches were set to. Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a bit faster than the LC III:  \t\tCentris610\t\tLCIII  CPU\t\t13.01\t\t\t6.92 Graf\t\t15.67\t\t\t7.69 Disk\t\t2.22\t\t\t2.44 Math\t\t25.57\t\t\t10.19  P.R. Rating\t12.91\t\t\t6.58  So, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed difference between these two machines according to Speedometer3.1.    Chad
