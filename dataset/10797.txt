They probably cannot tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they get their copy of your key.  Any criminal who has going to use encryption will do it under cover of Clipper.  The only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.  I probably should not say this, but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical properties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase the measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.  You can tell if the NSA built this feature in: blow on the mike, and observe whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling.  \t PGP 2 key by finger or e-mail    Eli   ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu
