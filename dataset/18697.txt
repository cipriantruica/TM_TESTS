Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate from your own reference frame. there is no inside and no outside, there are just two polarized views. As for statements inside the Bible, things are still not that clear, we do not have any indications for instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament, one of the  few books that actually talks about Satan. Jobs is very much out of line with the rest of the OT books, and there is a chance that someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures.  > Now in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a different > matter.

This operates the other way around as well. You have to understand the mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical relativist. If you do not understand the underlying concepts, it is  pretty hard to continue with a dialogue. i am not a perfect Christian, however about 20+ years of Christian teaching should have provided me with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame.
