If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the problem there is now.  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West did not care.  Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his Gorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections.  Well, the aid did not come through and we did not make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding.  > >Have you considered a non-interventionist policy?

If they do not reform I do not believe in giving them money.  However, I think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach. This is what really bugs me about Libertarianism -- it sounds like \'it shall all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to do anything.\' > > >>How does this affect us?

People already give over $100 billion a year to >charity.  Despite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting farther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the problem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.  Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity. There are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA cannot buy Proton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to help a great deal but it cannot right now.  There are too many obstacles. Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to  tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face. > >>Seriously.

I think *limited* government >is more key than how democratic it is.  Well, I think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government  is trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be painless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to help when they *have* the \'proper\' government.  they will never get there without the aid.  It may be too late already.  > >>BTW, who is to decide  istupid?\'  This is just like those who >>want to impose their \'morals\' on others -- just the sort of >>thing I thought Libertarians were against. > >That was an opinion, and libertarians are very big on free speech.

Consider it a compromise.  How much money would >your fellow Russia-aiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose >were not using the same government machine to steal money from you >and your group for causes you do not support?  As I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*. A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight. I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace.    > >>We could do that 100 years ago but not now. > >People have been saying that for hundreds of years.  They did not have nuclear weapons 100 years ago.

Yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of every person on the planet.    There must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government when it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of bounds.  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market is, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of government.   >  Julie DISCLAIMER:  All opinions here belong to my cat and no one else
