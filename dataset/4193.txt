From: rjacks@austlcm.sps.mot.com (rodney jacks) Subject: When is Apple going to ship CD300i is?  I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM drives for my c650, but my local Apple does not know  when they will be available.  He does not even have a part number yet.   Does anyone know what the part number  for this drive is and when it will be available?  My Apple dealer suggested I buy one of the CD300 external drives, but I do not want to pay extra for a case/power supply i am not going to use.  -Rodney Jacks (rjacks@austlcm.sps.mot.com)
