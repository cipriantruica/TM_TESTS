From: eastwood@sybase.com (David Eastwood) Subject: WRK Installation Oddity  Last night I tried to reinstall the utilities from the Windows 3.1 Resource Kit disk. The setup program appeared to run perfectly normally, but when it had finished, there was no Program Group created. Now, I know i have done this before successfully, and creating a group myself did not exactly tax me, but i am curious as to what might be going on. I can only assume that something left over from the last time I had it installed is getting in  the way, but I cannot figure out what. Any clues, anyone?  --   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- David Eastwood  /  Sybase Inc., Emeryville, CA  /  eastwood@sybase.com
