I guess what I am really asking, like I did above, how does my government who is my servent, tell me the soveriegn what I can or cannot possess?  It would seem to me that the act of possessing a machine gun is no less  criminal , by definition, than the act of possessing a television set. I also would seem to me that it would be better to pass laws that say, that if I harm or kill someone with the machine gun or the television set that there  would be specific penalties for doing such.   > >> Everyone knows that laws are constitional >> until it goes to court.
