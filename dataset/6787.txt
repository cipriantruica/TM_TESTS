Women is pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too shallow to use!  I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when she goes from building to a car. It is protect herself from would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who as a definite place of safty (ie a locked car!).  Puting keys and walet looks ugly! It breaks the lines and makes you rear look wide as a cows!   Also, to have the habits that work for any clothing situation, the pruse functions no mater what you are wearing! (even nude or a bikni)  A women is suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets (2 on the outside, none on the inside). I have men is coats that have as much as 6 pockets! This is definitally not fair!!!  As one that wears both men is and women is clothes, I can tell you, women is clothes have few if any funtional pockets!  When dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and my keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent than the pants pockets and looks better.  Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is paramout to a woman is safty. Men do not see this as a problem. A woman is aware of this every time she goes out! (i.e. Image some red necks yelling at you  We are going to FUCK YOU!  and the out weight you by 20 lbs and have 3 inches in hight on you!)  If you want to find out why a women does something, LIVE AS ONE!  Celeste
