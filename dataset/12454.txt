According to my physical >electronics prof, you cannot get an LED with that band gap. that is why you  he has mistaken. They exist, the semiconductor is silicon carbide, and they are inefficient and expensive. The bandgap is around 2.7 ev.  >do not find blue LEDs or, for that matter, some other colour of LEDs.

The ones I have are clear plastic. Pray tell, what would make a  typical  LED emit blue light?   --  David Josephson
