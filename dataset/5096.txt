Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return   memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does   not shrink).  > One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, > there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments > if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g.,  kill ).

First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,   attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone.   Now, if the client dies, that is one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)   and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it is resources,   including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more   shared memory segment.   Terrible, but it works.  \t\t\t\tRegards,  \t\t\t\t\tRichard Gooch....
