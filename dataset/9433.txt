I agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific argument.  That  has great hands  means nothing.  It seems to me that a first-baseman is defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily) from his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  How many such chances does he get during a game?  Many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is much higher than Grounder/Popup totals).  This implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line or in the dirt.   Good Hands  are needed for such plays, and thus have value.  I do not have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays, but i had guess that the values of these abilities are similar.  it is just like: you do not judge catcher is defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose).  Michael
