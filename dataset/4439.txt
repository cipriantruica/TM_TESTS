From: guykuo carson.u.washington.edu (Guy Kuo) Subject: IIsi clock Poll Results - Long  This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their IIsi clock oscillator. I have attempted to gather as many case histories as possible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24 machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present. This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.  Thanks to all who contributed to this poll.    Issues:  \tSpeed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without \t\tadd on cards. All reported machines were able to use \t\t25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple \t\tNubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter \t\twas able to go faster than 25 mhz. One was not even able to \t\tachieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place \t \t\tAt speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and \t\thi density floppy disk problems have been reported. \t\t \t\tNote: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not \t\t\ttested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence, \t\t\tthe 25 mhz operational machines may well work at \t\t\thigher speeds. \t\t\t \tDamage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was \t\trepaired and the machine is operational. One other \t\treported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator \t\tduring desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user \t\tputting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron. \t\t \t\tNo reports of static discharge damage. \t\t \t\tNo reports of high speed operation causing damage. \t\t \t\tThen again, I also do not have any reports from users of \t\tdefective parachutes. \t\t \tAdd on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus \t\tAdapters. Several other add on boards have been used with \t\tsuccess. See case histories \t\t \tHeat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed. \t\tThese were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some \t\tused epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab \t\tof cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a \t\tbolt through the hole in the motherboard. \t\t \t\t \t\t Case Histories:\t  All speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reported CPU versions were 20 mhz.  1)  27.5 mhz operational. Ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing.
