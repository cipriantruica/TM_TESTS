From: benha@castle.ed.ac.uk (Ben Hambidge) Subject: Committing my life to God?  Hi everyone,  i am trying to find my way to God, but find it difficult as I cannot hear God talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and that he knows me, and I feel that I cannot possibly get to know him until he does. Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just do not know or understand how to listen.  Some Christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find God is to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover. This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit frightening, but I have a few questions.  1) How do you actually commit yourself? If I just say,  OK God, her you go, i am committing my life to you , I would not really feel that he had listened - at least, I could not be sure that he had. So how does one (or how did you) commit oneself to God?  2) In committing myself in this way, what do I have to forfeit of my current life? What can I no longer do? I feel that i am as \'good\' as many Christians, and I try to uphold the idea of \'loving your neighbour\' - I do not go round killing people, stealing, etc., and I try not to get jealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to the standards of treating other people as well as many Christians. So what do I have to give up?  3) When committed, what do I have to do? What does it involve? What (if any) burdens am I taking on?  4) So then, what is the general difference before and after? I assume, that (like on your birthday you do not suddenly feel a year older) it will not suddenly change my life the day I commit myself. So what happens?  5) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do? How can I find out what the \'it\' in the last sentence actually _is_?!  Thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. Perhaps e-mail would be a better way to reply, but it is up to you.  Ben.      (20 year-old at University in Scotland)
