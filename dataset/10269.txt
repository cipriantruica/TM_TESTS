My \tpoint is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing \tthis year.  This year we had more skill, i am all for that, but \tif your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they \tcannot do you much good.  Whether it is a cheap shot or not you \tcannot let the other teams push you around.  The 1992-93 Sharks \tsimply got pushed around to much.  Other teams knew this. \tThey knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not \tpay for it.   Adding some players in the off season who will \tadd some toughness to the team will help insure that next \tseason other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously  \tcheck our skill players, or to take cheap shots.  It does not \tguarantee no injuries (nothing does), but it is something the \tSharks can do to reduce the number of injuries.    \tmark   just say                                              ____                                                                              -_ --__                                                                                --_                                                            -_                                                                   |                                                                   __________ /          _____                                          ___________ /             _____ ______________________________________________________________________________ Mark Spiegel  spiegel@lmsc.lockheed.com   Cow Palace:108/K/8  Epicenter: ?
