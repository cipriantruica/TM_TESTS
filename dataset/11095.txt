The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared \twith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 \tfor the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is \t16 Mbits a second. [...]  \tF, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips \tN, a 30-bit serial number \tU, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted \t\t with the chip \tThe key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then \tfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:    \t   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and  \t   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output: \t\tE[M;K] = 64 bits \t\tE[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits \t\tE[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip does not know the transmitter is U,    it presumably cannot check the validity of E[K;U], so it is     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there is some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip will not do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else is serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that is really E[M; K,U,N] ?   \tThanks! --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
