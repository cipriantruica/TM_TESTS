Also note the strange cross-posting (as he probably did not), so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends to mount it on.  If it *is* a PC (or clone), then the  2C  jumper would be the correct choice.  \ti have left the cross-posting in effect, since i am not sure which newsgroup he would really be reading this in. :-)  \tDoN. --   Email:     |  ...!uunet!ceilidh!dnichols  \t\t   Donald Nichols (DoN.)  |   Voice (Days): (703) 704-2280 (Eves): (703) 938-4564 \t--- Black Holes are where God is dividing by zero ---
