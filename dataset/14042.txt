In article  nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu writes:    Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..    Why not??  Because to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- where it is, which means you either nail it to something that does not move or you watch it all the time.  Neither of which is possible on a deactivated spacecraft.  Then you have to know exactly how far away from it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware on board.   Apart from which, there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons. -- Gregory Bond  Burdett Buckeridge & Young Ltd Melbourne Australia    Knox is 386 is slick.
