But for me it is true.  Windows crashed on all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception) .  OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they cannot touch each other or (generally) anything they are not supposed to have.  If windows works for you, then great.  Maybe this is why some people do not see why OS/2 is the OS of  choice.  If windows does not crash on you, and you do not mind waiting on each task, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of the key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it would be more of an even fight. Brett   --  Brett D.
