From: rcj2@cbnewsd.cb.att.com (ray.c.jender) Subject: Looking for a doctor   \tI was kind of half watching Street Stories last night \tand one of the segments was about this doctor in \tS.F. who provides a service of investigating treatment \tfor various diseases. i am pretty sure his name is \tDr. Mark Renniger (sp?) or close to that.  \tDid anyone else watch this? i had like to get his \tcorrect name and address/phone number if possible. \tThanks.
