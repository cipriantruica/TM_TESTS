From: darndt@nic.gac.edu (David Arndt) Subject: Johnny Hart is (B.C. comic strip) mailing address?  Subject pretty much says it all - i am looking for Johnny Hart is (creator of the B.C. comic stip) mailing address.  For those of you who have not seen them, take a look at his strips for Good Friday and Easter Sunday.  Remarkable witness!  If anyone can help me get in touch with him, i had really appreciate it!  i have contacted the paper that carries his strip and -- they will get back to me with it!
