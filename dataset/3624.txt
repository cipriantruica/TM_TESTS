We installed a second phone line in our home (for our kids), and whenever one of them is on THEIR line, the modem returns  NO DIAL TONE  on its line.  When we pick up the phone and listen, we can hear my kids\' voices  bleed  through.  Whenever we can hear this, the modem will not dial (even though the dial tone is loud and clear through the modem speaker).  I think it is the phone company is problem, but they say they cannot (will not?) correct the problem...i am still working on them. ;-} --   Reid R.
