The government is notoriously sloppy with physical, communications, and information security.  They cannot keep their computers safe, and they are  trying .  Read  DEA is Not Adequately Protecting National Security Information  [GAO/IMTEC 92-31] for an excellent example of what i am talking about.  Private sector organizations tend to be even more lax in their security measures. I believe that the escrow organizations will be penetrated by foreign intelligence services within months, if not weeks, of their selection.  Private organizations that lack the resources of a full-fleged intelligence service will take longer - perhaps on the order of one to two years.  Nonetheless, the penetrations will take place, without question.  Philip R.
