Comments about  who needs backup copies ?  and  YOU do  deleted....  i shall toss in my 2 cents worth - i have begun to think that distribution disks are made on some of the least reliable floppy disk stocks available. we have been especially plagued by Borland is distribution disks.  i am  lucky if I can install from them as many as 3 times before they crap  out on me.  So definitely, as a matter of course we ALWAYS make copies to do our installations with.  -- paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ ..........   .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . .  .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  .     .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .
