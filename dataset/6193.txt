I typically         get 3-4 hours of battery life.  The battery recharges in 2 hours to          full charge.   The machine is quite speedy; I run OS/2 2.1beta \ton it currently and will leave this operating system installed unless \tyou prefer MS-DOS 5.0 (included).             i shall include a padded carrying case, also made by Toshiba.
