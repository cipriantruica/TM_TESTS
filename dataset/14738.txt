I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net. My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that is really beside the point. What does the Roman Catholic church say?  Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law.  After all we Orthodox do not cinsider ourselves schismatic or excommunicated.  But the Catholic Church considers us dissident.  If this is inappropriate for this group or beyond the charter, i am sure OFM will let us know.

Whether this is actually the best group in which to discuss it is up to the people concerned.  I am not interested in having this reinvoke the general Catholic/Protestant polemics, but I do not see why it should -- the issue is primarily one specific to Catholics.  --clh]
