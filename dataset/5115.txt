From: dscheck@nextsrv1.andi.org (David Scheck) Subject: Imake cpp problems on AIX   I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems.  (1) Many of my Imakefile is have contructs like \t\t/**/ This is a makefile \tat the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C \tpreprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that \tI have used will not treat such a   as appearing at the start of the \tline.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the \tstart of a directive.   \tHowever the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol \tas the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines \tthat  This  is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my \timake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better \tfix.  (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular \tuse of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp \tgives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.  If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp is that behave similarly?  Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to \'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com\' would be appreciated.
