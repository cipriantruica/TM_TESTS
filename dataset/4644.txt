From: rts@nwu.edu (Ted Schreiber) Subject: Recs on  Mac Video System -Cards Software?  What would be a good platform for some fairly basic video work of the following nature:  Reading real video in for playbak in various app is 5-10 Minnutes in length Basic editing features for said video - rearange sequences, adding grapic slides from something like power point etc...   i am not to familiar with this stuff but would like a good system with crisp performance.  it is for educational/promotional things so the video quality should be decent.  i am thinking Tempest or cyclone, Big drive,loads o ram, Floptical or 128Mb optical ?? - however, i am not to sure of the various cards and software thats out there.  Please email any responses,  Thanks  Ted Schreiber Mechanical Enginering  Northwestern University Tel: 708.491.5386 FAX 708.491.3915 Email: rts@nwu.edu
