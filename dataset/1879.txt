From: oddjob@oz.plymouth.edu (Andrew C. Stoffel) Subject: Re: Help with changing Startup logo  There has been a long running discussion over changing the Startup logo for Windows for a few weeks here. While all the COPY methods are great & have not seen any mention of a program that will do it for you.....   Well... I found one on CICA called winlogo (cannot remember where unfortuantely), and it seems to work real well... even comes with a couple example .RLE files.   What i had really like though is a way to create .RLE files myself, specifically the RLE4 format mentioned in the winlogo readme file. Can anyone point me in the direction of such a beast with a REAL directory path ?? All the ones i have seen mentioned did not pan out..... --  |E-mail  --> un*x: oddjob@oz.plymouth.edu |vms: andys@psc.plymouth.edu | |Disclaimer > Any  end-user  software that provides NO avenue for user | |of the week> modification or programmability is NOT user friendly.    |
