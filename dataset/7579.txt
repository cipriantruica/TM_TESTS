From: kmac@cisco.com (Karl Elvis MacRae) Subject: Ford Explorer question, and SUV review.   \tOk, so in my ongoing search for a sport utility, here is the latest;   Toyota 4runner:  \t Small. Small Small Small. The interior of this vehical is impossible \tfor a large person. Too bad; it would have been the winner otherwise.  Nissan Pathfinder: \t \tVery low ceiling. My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also has \ta cheap-looking interior.  Isuzu Trooper:  \tClass act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable, \thandled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE. But it is huge, \tand the engine is a bit too small for it is bulk; also the manual shift is  \tweird and kind of awkward. i had buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10  \tshorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to  \tpark in in San Francisco. No Thanks.   Chevy Blazer:  \tCheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still  \ttoo small.  Ford Explorer:  \tThis is no sports car, and it is certainly not for the serious off roader. \tBut it is big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the \ttrooper. it is engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would \tbe nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and \tshoulders above my \'90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as i had like, \tbut it is acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to get \tinto, in fact, than the driver is seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10  shorter \twheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, i am a manual  \tshift biggot, I admit it...) it is the one i am thinking of buying.    \tSo, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it? \tAnyone had any major problems? Heard any horror stories?   \tAlso, any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo, both being essentially \tthe same vehical?   \t\t\tThanks-   \t-Karl     -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-   Karl Elvis MacRae\tSoftware Release Support\tCisco Systems   kmac@cisco.com -or- batman@cisco.com     415-688-8231   DoD# 1999  FJ1200   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- \t       Shovels and rakes and implements of destruction  \t\t\t\t\t\t-Arlo Guthrie
