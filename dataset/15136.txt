Is it in the Bible?

(although a lot of it is just the result of a bible concordance program called  quickverse  -- it is really lousy, by the way -- do not buy it.)   >Wondering, >Eddie >______ __   ___  ___           o  __   ___  |    Western  Kentucky    | >  /   /__) /__  /__  /     )  /  /__) /__   |       University        | > /   /    (___ (___ (__/__/  /  /    (___   |  EASTEEE@WKUVX1.BITNET  |  hope this helped! vera ______ je cherche une ame, qui\t\t\tof course i do not agree with   pourra m\'aider\t\t\t\tmylene farmer is religious views; je suis\t\t\t\t\ti just think they are interesting. d\'une generation desenchantee\t\t(vera noyes)     - mylene farmer\t\t\tnoye@midway.uchicago.edu
