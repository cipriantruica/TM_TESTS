Henry, I made the assumption that he who gets there firstest with the mostest wins.   Ohhh, you want to put in FINE PRINT which says  Thou shall do wonderous R&D rather than use off-the-shelf hardware ? Sorry, did not see that in my copy. Most of the Pournellesque proposals run along the lines of  reward for .    You go ahead and do your development, i shall buy off the shelf at higher cost (or even Russian; but I also assume that there would be some  Buy US  provos in there) and be camped out in the Moon while you are launching and assembling little itty-bitty payloads in LEO with your laser or gas gun.  And working out the bugs of assembly & integration in LEO.   Oh, hey, could I get a couple of CanadARMs tuned for the lunar environment?  I wanna do some teleoperated prospecting while i am up there...         Software engineering? that is like military intelligence, is not it?   -- >                  SYSMGR@CADLAB.ENG.UMD.EDU                        < --
