Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the henrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan.   BM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities \t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ henrik]\tAgain, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do henrik]\twant them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  News reports i have seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.   CAPS do not change facts.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia does not need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    henrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  henrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.  So?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about  DEFENSE etc.?  I do not know how \'fully engaged\' Turkey is/was though.  henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM] Huh?  You did not expect Azeri is to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?    henrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into  henrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  So I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] you are not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?  henrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped henrik] into Armenia if SHE could.  Why would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash that Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region, like economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  i had be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET rather than \'who killed whom in what way\' which I detest doing and would not  do.    BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?    henrik]\t   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik]\t   cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   Even if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in \'74.  If there would been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the time, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what i have said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]  BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  that is hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.  henrik]\t   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey henrik]\t   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!  So what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?    henrik]\t   I will believe it when I see it.  No, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.  henrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing henrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)? \t This kind of childish rhetoric does not help anthing.  henrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the henrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean henrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !  Now, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive, right?  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that is  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.    henrik]\t   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are  henrik]\t   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY  henrik]\t   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   Well they obviously are not getting anywhere with their current methods of asking (not very peaceful i had say).  BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  henrik]\t   do not get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the henrik]\t   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in henrik]\t   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  I do not know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans. Peace is not what is happening right now, furthermore what is happening right now is not condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights  raving about how \'right\' the Armenian position is and i am sure there\'ll be others who had be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia is not strong enough to exercise the \'we think we are right, and we have the  bombs, so we will do whatever we want, so there...\' style of foreign  relations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided atrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to  the other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course, this being just USENET.  The people in power should not be so childish.   BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.   henrik]\t   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension henrik]\t   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH henrik]\t   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  Azeri is would disagree with you on this, and the maps i have seen support what they would be saying.  It does not seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner.    BM] it is easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there is peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  i had push for BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM] inflammatory half-truths.  henrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely henrik]   for it.   It did not look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me  that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair?  henrik] But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself, henrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of henrik] The Armenian Massacres.  You do not realize I can say the same thing about \'The Turkish Massacres.\' Yes, boys and girls, let us always talk about how bad and nasty things were. let us do that so we are overwhelmed by anger, and let us do that so our kids will also be hateful.  Sounds crazy does not it?  do not do it then.  BM
