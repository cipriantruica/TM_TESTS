Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a  character  containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.  This means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit time slot, which basically indicates a BREAK.  There is no special way to detect BREAK that I have found other than this -- there is no magic signal generated by UARTs, etc.  Alan Mimms (alan@apple.com, ...!apple!alan)   | My opinions are generally Portable Macintosh Software Group             | pretty worthless, but Apple Computer                                | they *are* my own...
