In article  georgel@NeoSoft.com (George Livsey) writes:       I am aware of the restrictions imposed by the munitions act    on the export of cryptographic technology, however, is it illegal to    transmit encrypted data from the U.S. to another country?  If so,    then which laws apply to this situation?  From the US law perspective, unless you are engaging in illegal speech, it is not illegal to use encryption.  Yet.  The NSA is allowed to try to listen, but you are not obligated to make it easy for them.  Yet. The other country may have more repressive laws about that; I gather France is bureaucracy wants to know what you are saying,  and in the old Soviet Union, they did not need laws to make things illegal :-(  (paranoia follows, for those of you who want to play it safe :-) The fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use wimpy crypto technologies, but it may also affect your willingness to use technologies that violate RSA is patents, e.g. if you use PGP, the NSA may tell RSA that you are doing so, and if the Secret Service catches on, they may decide that the mere fact that RSA has not filed a lawsuit against you does not mean that you do not deserve to have your computer confiscated for possible patent violation, munitions law violation, espionage, money laundering, drug importation, and creatin\' a disturbance, and then not give it back because you *did* violate the patent even though they had to drop all the other charges, unlike that nasty Steve Jackson who had the gall not to be guilty of *anything*. --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
