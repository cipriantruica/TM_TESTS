Other studies, including the just-published  Janus Report , give very different figures.  The Janus Report figures are not too different than Kinsey: 9% homosexual men, and 4% bisexual men.  >-> Earlier studies have been all over the map also.    >I think he has talking about Kinsey who came up with the 10% >statistic used heavily by gay groups to push their political agenda. >Kinsey is work has often been accused of lacking a strong scientific >backbone.    do not be stupid.
