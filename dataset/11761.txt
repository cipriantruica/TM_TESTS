From: cab@col.hp.com (Chris Best) Subject: Re: Uninterruptible Power Supply  i am no expert at UPS is, but you said something that made it sound like you did not realize something.  On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway), there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual  condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but  there is something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time?  Then there would be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC on charge when the power is on, and it shall be there in zero time when you  need  it.  Just some ideas.  cannot guarantee what will work or not, but hope at least SOME of this helped.
