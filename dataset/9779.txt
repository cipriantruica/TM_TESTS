That he did this was a good thing...it is better he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would truly jeopardize the franchise.  Pocklington is first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell a minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value of the team) and to get a better arena deal, either in Northlands, or via a new building.  Pocklington probably is not going to get exactly what he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or will sell to someone who will probably get enough.  There are a lot of risks in moving a team also...  ...one has to remember  Peter Puck is principle ...it is better to spend other people is money than one is own if at all possible.  Gerald
