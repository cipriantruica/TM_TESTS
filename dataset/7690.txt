Moreover, if two riders are riding together at the same speed, one might be riding well beyond his abilities and the other may have a safety margin left.  >Oh come on Phil.  you are an excellent rider, but you still take plenty of >chances.  do not tell me that it is just your skill that keeps you from  >getting wacked.  there is a lot of luck thrown in there too.  you are a very >good rider and a very lucky one too.  Hope your luck holds....   Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls. On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you, you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when you were surprised by an oncoming car.  That crash was due to factors that were subject to your control.  I will not deny that there is a combination of luck and skill involved for each of us, but it seems that you are blaming bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted. --      Chuck Karish          karish@mindcraft.com     (415) 323-9000 x117   karish@pangea.stanford.edu
