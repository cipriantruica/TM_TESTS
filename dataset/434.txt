You got me thinking now!  This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a  move in society to classify previously  socially unacceptable  yet legal  activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two  coexisting methods of social control.  First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of  actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set  of punishments.  Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are  the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered  by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if  socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed  since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of  social censure.  The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as  guilt  and   morality .  i have heard it said (and fully believe) that if it were not for  the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be  absolutely impossible.  Lately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to  attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it am not  illegal, then do not pick on me).  i am not saying this is wrong, merely  that it is a byproduct of a society which has:  \t1) A high education level, \t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media, \t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and \t4) A  me  oriented culture.  I guess what i am saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition,  here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can  cannot allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we  are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as  those freedoms do not impinge on another is.  IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we  appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old  territoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized,  inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the  continued destabilization of society.    I got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this  mess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms  in order to  stabilize  society.  Yet I believe development of societies  follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a  social model which maximizes indiv. freed. is yet is stable?  Perhaps it is  possible to live with a  non-stable  society?  Anybody see a way out?  Comments?  PS.  Therefore answer to question    We do not.  Do we want to?
