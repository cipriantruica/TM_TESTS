From: havardn@edb.tih.no (Haavard Nesse,o92a) Subject: HELP!!! GRASP  Hi!  Could anyone tell me if it is possible to save each frame of a .gl (grasp) animation to .gif, .jpg, .iff or any other picture formats.  (i have got some animations that i had like to transfer to my Amiga)   I really hope that someone can help me.  Cheers  Haavard Nesse - Trondheim College of Engineering, Trondheim, Norway
