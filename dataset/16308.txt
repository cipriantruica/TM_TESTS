From:  Subject: Re: Change of name ??  Post all you want, foreigner.  we would rather hear from you than those  i shall support the fascist who writes the hecks for my salary  .edu site types!  Should you expect the Police to come in and assault you, lay siege and refuse to help when they (yes, let us give them the benefit of the doubt) accidently burn down your ranch home?  Even though ey have emergency vehicles nearby?  Is this a proper response when you just keep to yourself? Even if you DON\'T hurt anyone?  And you \'re cooperative with cops when you occasionally come out?  I hope not. -watkins@earth.eecs.uic.edu .
