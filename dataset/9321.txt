Sorry, Roger, I wronged you.. you are not boring ALL the time..  This one is a classic. \'cordially, as always\' HEHEHEHEHHE!  \tAre you a jerk?  \t\tDo people hate you?  \t\t\tAre you no fun at parties?  \tWell! Come to the ROGER MAYNARD SCHOOL OF CORDIALITY!  \tWe can teach you to be \'cordial\' with the best of them! Use such time honored \'cordiality\' techniques as:  \t1) Calling people assholes! \t2) Comparing them to viruses!  \tFor advanced students:  \t3) Comparing them to DIRTY viruses. What is a DIRTY virus, \t\tand how can you tell it from a clean one? We know, \t\tand here at the ROGER MAYNARD SCHOOL OF CORDIALITY, \t\twe can teach you to know, too!  \tHEHEHEH.. Thanks, Roger.. This made my evening :-)  Tom
