From: vojak@icebucket.stortek.com (Bill Vojak) Subject: Question on Senate Bills   i am writting letters to my Congresscritters and was wondering if  there is any reason(s) why I should NOT support the following  Bills, other than the previous comments about S.458.  Just checking  before I mail the letter to make sure I do not support something  that I really should not.   -----------------  I strongly SUPPORT the following laws currently being considered in Congress  as they would either have a positive effect towards reducing crime, or re-  enforce our Constitutional right under the 2nd amendment.   * S. 441 (Campbell)\tTo amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a \t\t\tmandatory minimum sentence for the unlawful possession \t\t\tof a firearm by a convicted felon, a fugitive from \t\t\tjustice, a person who is addicted to, or an unlawful \t\t\tuser of, a controlled substance, or a transferor or \t\t\treceiver of a stolen firearm, to increase the general \t\t\tpenalty for violation of Federal firearms laws, \t\t\tand to increase the enhanced penalties provided for the  \t\t\tpossession of a firearm in connection with a crime of  \t\t\tviolence or drug trafficking crime, and for other \t\t\tpurposes.   * S.458  (Smith) \tTo restore the second Amendment Rights of all Americans.   * S.488  (Specter)\tTo provide Federal penalties for drive-by shootings.   * S.504  (Kohl)\tTo amend section 924 of title 18, United States Code to \t\t\tmake it a Federal crime to steal a firearm or explosives \t\t\tin interstate or foreign commerce.

Then her husband became a media  martyr, now she wants to take all your guns away.
