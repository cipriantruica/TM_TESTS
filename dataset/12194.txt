The really high-powered devices are arrays of 3, 6, or 9, LED is on a TO-66 header.  The 9-chip model puts out 6.5 Watts in response to a 5 Amp, 10 uS. pulse at a .5% duty cycle.  I think  these are designed as illuminators for IR vision systems.  I would also be interested in the application here.  I work with a Dance and Technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot wide stage from 50 feet away.
