Subject: items for sale [must sell] From: koutd@hiramb.hiram.edu (DOUGLAS KOU)  Items for sale.....  This package was bought throught a award give-away company. I attempted to cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late and the company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truth which I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back as close as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...  Nishika 3D camera\tIt takes very good picture, never been opended \t\t\tor used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring \t\t\tcase, film, and a instruction video. It has four \t\t\tlens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm \t\t\tfilm.  Jewelry\t\t\tIt came with the package as additional gift.  Bahama vacation voucher\tThe voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport. \t\t\tThe users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person \t\t\tper-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is \t\t\t_not_ included.  Las Vegas, Reno, Orlando\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and \t\t\t\thotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights. \t\t\t\tMeals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not \t\t\t\tincluded. The voucher is good for all 3 \t\t\t\tlocations, but you cannot travel to all 3 \t\t\t\tplaces at once.  Cancun, Mexico\t\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel \t\t\taccomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and \t\t\tground transfer, hotel tax is not included as \t\t\tusual.  I paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you make your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell the whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation vouchers, I do not care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric If you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift.  If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards.  Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is  only one award which will be given away. So do not bother even to call them  back, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper  price. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three  months to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit  card company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price.  If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really wish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with your offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning. More details could be given if you wish.
