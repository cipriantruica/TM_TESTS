From: stone-andy@cs.yale.edu (Andy Stone) Subject: Re: How to the disks copy protected.   \tI wrote a commercial program called GAME-MAKER (can you guess what it does).  What we do is have a document protect (answer Question on page x,  line y), which is a real pain.  We also allow the user to register by sending in a card, and computing a   based on their name.  The system works in that we have gotten lots of registration cards. \tI hear that the program has been cracked though.  Someone two people  actually called up my support--one with a question, the other wanting to buy our graphics libraries (right!).  Anyway if anyone wants to help me catch a cracker and has the cracked version, mail me.  I will not accuse you (unless you are the cracker of course).  --                                              Andy Stone       -\t\t\t\t\t     stonea@suned.cs.yale.edu --                                               Andy Stone       -\t\t\t\t\t     stonea@suned.cs.yale.edu
