From: admiral@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu (Steve C Liu) Subject: spring records  \tThe Orioles\' pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season. Four shutouts, low team ERA, (Well, I have not gotten any baseball news since March 14 but anyways) Could they contend, yes. Could they win it all?  Maybe.  But for all those fans of teams with bad spring records, remember Earl Weaver is first law of baseball (From his book on managing)  No one gives a damn in July if you lost a game in March. :)  BTW, anyone have any idea on the contenders for the O is fifth starter? it is pretty much set that Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald and Rhodes are the first four in the rotation.  Here at Johns Hopkins University where the mascot is the Blue Jay :(, their baseball team logo was the Toronto club is logo. Now it is a  anatomically correct blue jay. God, cannot they think of an original idea? it is even in the same pose as the baltimore oriole on the O is hats. How many people realize that the bird is really called a baltimore oriole? __________________________________________________________________________ |Admiral Steve C.
