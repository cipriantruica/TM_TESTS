Not if you have scored four runs, you do not!  Why strain even the best pitching staff?  Why not make it easier for them?    In the 2-1 game, the best pitching staff in the world cannot compensate for a blown call, a bad hop, a gust of wind.  Winning close is the  wrong way to win; both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot  yourself are insurance against the  Shit happens  aspect of baseball.  Not every great teamhas even *good* pitching.  The Big Red Machine of the 70 is was league-average in pitching.  But somehow, Rose-Morgan-Bench- Perez-etc. managed to win 100 games more than once, peaking at 108.  Roger
