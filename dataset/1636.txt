From: wolfram@rbg.informatik.th-darmstadt.de (Wolfram Kresse) Subject: XV for DOS: what is the problem?  I downloaded the file xv221exe.zip from the site someone posted here. It contained the files:   CJPEG.EXE   DJPEG.EXE   XV.EXE  When I tried to run it, it just said   could not run go32.exe  and halts.  what is the matter with this?  Are there some files missing in the .zip? What is go32.exe?  any help appreciated.  bye,  Wolfram  --  +-------+---------------------------------------------------------------+ |       |Wolfram Kresse * E-Mail: wolfram@rbg.informatik.th-darmstadt.de| |  ~ ~  +--------------------------+---------------+--------------------+ |  + +  | Meeneemeeneemeenee       |CU l8r, LE g8r!| |   I   | Yes,that is right,Tweeky. +---------------+ | _____ +-----+----+---------------+ |     U | 8^) | =) | +-------+-----+----+
