Hope this helps and correct me if i am wrong.  you are right.  You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II 800K 3.5  disk or Apple II 5.25  disk without extra hardware. However, Mac 1.44MB disks can be read and written in a PC 3.5  HD drive with software only.   This should probably be added to every PC and Mac FAQ file. It sure gets asked enough.
