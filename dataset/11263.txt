Right.  People here believe the government is listening in on everything.  Sure.  If you cannot provide an answer, change the assumptions to something you can deal with.  it is not a matter of the government listening on on everything, it is a matter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in. Say, if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a mall, the Secret Service decides to go for a warrantless search, and acquires your name.  it is a matter of any number of possible wiretap abuses that cryptology makes far less likely, and this chip can sabotage.   Par for the course, though.  I predicted that you had be jumping in in favor of this.  The reply was that you had justify anything up to and including death camps as long as the government backed them and had a written policy statement.  Perhaps a little extreme, but not much. --   Seattle  is an Indian word meaning  52 degrees and raining.
