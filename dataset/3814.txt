Also how much would one cost?  i have had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler, but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies, the owners of the board is compression technology. (i am writing this from memory; i have lost the reference. Please correct me if i am wrong.)  Using the board, i have had problems with file icons being lost, but it is hard to say whether it is the board is fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.  Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed. Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac is product since they are being so stinky.
