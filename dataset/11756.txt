From: dgj2y@kelvin.seas.Virginia.EDU (David Glen Jacobowitz) Subject: Dumb Question: Function Generator   \tI have a new scope and I thought i had save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there seems to be a bias even when the \'pull-offset\' is pushed in. That is, I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mV bias. \tThe other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output will not go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10 is of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series. With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now with this little divider there I have to figure that in. it is kind of a pain in  the ass. \tIs there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but i had like to have this box not be active. \tAny quick ideas. The scope is not broken. For other reasons I had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The function generator was the same way on that one, too.  \t\t\tplease help as I am feeling very stupid  \t\t\ttoday,  \t\t\t\t\t\tdave  \t\t\t\t\t\tdgj2y@virginia.edu
