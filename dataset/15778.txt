Now we know that Kratz does not understand what a safety is supposed to do.  (He also confuses  things he can see  with  things that exist ; Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the outside.)  A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS that is what the user wants.  With Glocks, one says  I want the gun to go off  by pulling the trigger.  If the safeties it has make that work, it has a  real  safety, no matter what Kratz thinks.  -andy --
