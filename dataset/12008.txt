Subject: Pattern Generator wanted From: grimwood@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Tony Grimwood)  I repair a lot of monitors here, and i had like to know where I can get a pattern generator (or a circuit for one) that will provide MDA, EGA and VGA signals. Using a whole PC to do this takes up too much space on my bench, and is somewhat less than portable. I guess I could sit down and design something, but I do not have the time right now - any (reasonable) suggestions would be appreciated.
