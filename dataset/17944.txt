The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.    Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,     Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that    homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general     population.  it is a shame that we do not have a breakdown for     men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically    how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.      Possibly because gay/bi men are less likely to get married?  Marriage is not a requirement for a couple staying together.    What was the purpose of this post?  If it was to show a mindless obsession   with statistics, an incredibly flawed system of reasoning, and a repellent   hatemonger agenda, then the purpose was accomplished with panache.      (a) Get a clue.  (b) Get a life.  (c) Get out of my face.  i am not in yours.      ----bi    Andrew D. Simchik\t\t\t\t\tSCHNOPIA!  Yes you are.  When you and the rest of the homosexual community pass laws to impose your moral codes on me, by requiring me to hire, rent to, or otherwise associate with a homosexual against my will, yes, you are in my face.  Until homosexuals stop trying to impose their morals on me, I will be in your face about this. --  Clayton E. Cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer  My opinions, all mine!
