How about this argument:  1)  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms.  2)  Strong cryptography is  arms , according to the U.S. government (that is     why it is so hard to export).  Therefore, we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography!   Q.E.D.  However, it is likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly restricting.  Maybe the NRA _would_ be the best existing organization? (Although I think a new one might be better, but perhaps would take too long to start up.  I would certainly join.) --  | From the electronic desk of Bob Langford          Health Sciences Computing | 804-786-9843   (fax: 804-786-9807)         Virginia Commonwealth University | e-mail:  langford@gems.vcu.edu     [or]     langford@vcuvax  (for BITNET)
