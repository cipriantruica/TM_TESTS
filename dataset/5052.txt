You are right but PLEASE DON\'T DO THIS.  It makes my brain hurt. USPosition and USSize should ONLY be set if the USER specified the position and size.  You say:  Tom, do not blow a gasket, what is the harm?   Some window managers do very different things (besides positioning the window) when they see USPosition rather than PPosition.  -- Tom LaStrange        toml@boulder.ParcPlace.COM
