From: yousten@atlantis.CSOS.ORST.EDU (Ken Yousten) Subject: Pecota (Braves)  Could someone out there send me Pecota is stats for the last few years, or something to give me some sort of  feel  for what kind of player he is? My mind has no handle on him at all, it bothers me.  Pecota of the Braves, that is.  Pretty meaningful that I cannot even come up with his first name, I think.. -- Ken Yousten\t\t If at first you do not succeed, try again. Blacksburg, VA\t\tThen quit. No use being a damn fool about it.  yousten@atlantis.csos.orst.edu\t\tW.C. Fields
