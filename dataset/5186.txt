There are several products you might investigate.  If you have got $20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good choice.  It is not compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I do not have contact information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who should not be too hard to find.  If you are running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook (hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting, but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.  You might also look at our product MetaCard.  we are alpha-testing direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we have even made the test release available for anonymous FTP), so we are obviously the closest in functionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs $495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.
