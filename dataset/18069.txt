What evidence are you aware of. What was reported in the media, or all of the evidence that was presented at the trial.  This sounds to me a lot like the first Rodney King 5 trial. A bunch of people who saw 10 to 15 seconds out of a several minute long video, decided that they knew more than people who had sat through a two week trial. --  Mob rule is not any prettier merely because the mob calls itself a government It am not charity if you are using someone else is money.
