There are other animals on this planet with advanced \tmental facilities which have not developed  religion  as a \tsatisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?  \tFurther, it appears that only humans have a  need  to explain the \tunexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet, \tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly \tcontent in their ignorance.  \ti had like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me \tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal \t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need \tnot be researched; 3) religion was  made up  by humans to address a \tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that \tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical \tstructure with biology at the apex).  \tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion   and the \tunderlying presuppositions.  >Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  >because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life >a safety blanked to hide behind.   Oh wow..all i have to do is  >follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.  >For all of you  found jeezus  , how many of you were  on the brink?   \tI disagree that Christianity is  an infectious cult .  It has \tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in \tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia. \tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is \t infectious  in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides \ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this \tis the case).  \tI disagree that Christianity is  a safety blanket  which supplants \thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one \tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a \tChristian is source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to \tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose \tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of \tcontrol over one is own life the problem or is it something else?  \tFinally, one does not appropriate  eternal happiness  by following \tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance \tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people \tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the \tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian \tin the Person of God is Spirit.  \tHeaven is one of two final states that \tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally \tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this \tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived \tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.  >but i digress...

However, it is not the penultimate \tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word, \tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum). \tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting \tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits \tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful \tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask \t Why?   Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom- \tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it \tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian \tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of \tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot \tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or \tharm others if the sole purpose of being a  friend  is to gain a \tconversion).  \tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep- \tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a  hurry-up  \tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no \tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was \tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open \tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now). \tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings \tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part \t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.  >We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we >die.        \tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die \tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more \tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is \tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find \ta more expansive view.  \t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing \tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language \tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so? \tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social \tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)  >Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.  \tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive. \tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not \ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship \twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close- \tknit relationship with this appelation.  >Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject >themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   \tThere are  Jesus freaks  who let the emotional aspects of worship \tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so, \tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these \tthings flow.  >It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious >wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  \tGuilty by association?  That  christianity  which forces itself \tupon another is not Christianity at all.  >When Christians see a  non-believer , they say that person is blind >to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live >with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet    >who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans >were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities >needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time >of dire need.  \tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened \t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?  \tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus\' influence was a sole \tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years \tgone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert \tthat nothing about Jesus\' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.  >I must go.
