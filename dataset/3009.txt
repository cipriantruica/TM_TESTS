From: begolej@csgrad.cs.vt.edu (James Begole) Subject: 16MB ISA limit?  I was just reading in PC Magazine that the peripherals in a PC with an ISA bus can only access 16MB of memory.  Also, that some video cards on the ISA bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to.  So that if I wanted to put 16MB of memory on my PC, my video card would not have anywhere to map it is memory to.  Can someone explain this in more detail.  Is there a way around this limit.  If you email me a response, I will summarize. \t-Bo\tbegolej@csgrad.cs.vt.edu --  \t--James  Bo  Begole\t\tbegolej@csgrad.cs.vt.edu
