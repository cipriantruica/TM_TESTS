Umm...  I beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning\'\'. The SDNS protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multiple encryption systems, as does PEM.  (And i had love to see how they would mandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it....)  Mind you, i am not saying that multiple algorithms will actually be used -- but the relevant technologies certainly provide for them, which certainly casts doubt on your choice of words.
