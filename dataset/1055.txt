From: agiacalo@nmsu.edu (Toni Giacalo) Subject: need algorithm for reading and displaying bitmap files  i am making a customized paint program in DOS and need an algorithm for reading bitmap files like GIF, PCX, or BMP.  Does anyone have such an algorithm?  i have tried copying one out of a book for reading .PCX format but it does not work.  I will take an algorithm for any format that can be created from Windows Paint.   Thanks! Toni
