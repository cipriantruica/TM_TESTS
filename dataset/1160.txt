Would that engulf alt.graphics.pixutils?  Or would that be  programmer ?  I do not know if traffic is really heavy enough to warrant a newsgroup split.  Look how busy comp.graphics.research is (not).  it is true that a lot of the traffic here is rehashing FAQs and discussing things that would probably be better diverted to system-specific groups, but I do not know whether a split would help or hurt that cause.  Maybe we need a comp.graphics.RTFB for all those people who cannot be bothered to read the fine books out there.  Right, Dr. Rogers? :-)  ab
