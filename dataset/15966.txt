And another one:  has not enyone heard of a leader is recon?  This is when the leader of the assult goes and looks at the objective to see if anything has changed that would affect the mission.  Even the Freshman cadets here in ROTCland know about them.  Mostly because they know it as the part where they  lie on the cold ground for an hour or so, but they have heard about it. Maybe the ATF should have hired out to the local ROTC guys!   --  Andrew Diederich                    diederic@spot.colorado.edu  These opinions are only mine on alternate Tuesdays.
