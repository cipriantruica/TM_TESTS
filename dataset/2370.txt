From: slg@slgsun.att.com (The Idealistic Cynic) Subject: How do I quickly switch between Windows screen resolutions?    Can someone out there tell me how to switch Window is screen resolution quickly and easily?  I know that I can go back into install to do it, but what i had really like is to have is the ability to just change a couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution changed.  I already have both video drivers that I need on my system, so that is not a problem.   Thanks,   Sean.   --- Sean L.
