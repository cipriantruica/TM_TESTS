From: jeffreyb@netcom.com (Jeff Budzinski) Subject: Apple Monitor Woes  I have a 3 month old that seems to have acquired the jitters of late.  The 14  Apple color monitor that i am using with an LCIII sort of jiggles to the left and right all the time now. I have attempted to relocate the monitor to make sure the problem is not interference from something else, but the  problem seems to remain no matter what I do.  Has anybody encountered this problem?  Thanks,  Jeff Budzinski (jeffreyb@netcom.com)
