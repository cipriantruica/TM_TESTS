And maybe that is not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits are nearly impossible, and you cannot sue the provincial health officials at all.  >  >Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French >and Germans do (hey, why do not they criticize France and Germany?

Oh no. do not let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is.

Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa. Theoretically it is limited to service personnel, but some studies i have heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but are not  urgent  at all.  The problem is, in a system where hospitals\' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you are an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you are put on any hospital is  urgent  care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK  unless you are someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.  >>WOULDN\'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW   >>FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?   >> >>In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental   >>care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private   >>hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private   >>insurance.

How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they did not stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers,  the services they expect from the province just will not be there in a few years  (Fortunately for them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the  Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He did not say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the  truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? they would be under no  obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they would be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling  such basic services, too).  >  >>******************************************************************   >> >>WOULDN\'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY   >>ACHE AND PAIN?   >> >>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about   >>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical   >>bills.   >> >>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor is -- have a lower   >>per-person health bill than we do. >  >It is  free  in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two >things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like >real health insurance -- which actually it is).

Again, I doubt Americans would like giving the insurance companies that much power. I half wonder if the Canadian health insurers did not go along with the provinces and the federal government years ago because they knew that there was a good chance of the public system going bust in the long run, and then  afterwards they could clean up (Okay, this sort of contradicts what I said higher up. But it is another possibility). they would have an added bonus when  arguing against government involvement in their industry-as they could then  point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles.
