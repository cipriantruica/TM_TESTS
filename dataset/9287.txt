From: rstimets@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (robert and stimets) Subject: Belcher terrific; Tomlin not; Reds win 5-0: RedReport 4-20  Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won  their second straight 5-0.  Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and  often by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some recently rare power with their bats.  Belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the game progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while striking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working for him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on  breaking balls.  Tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch double to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and  Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys (Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact they all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal and a Tomlin wild pitch.  In fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only 2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would  later score on Reggie Sanders\' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead  after 4.  The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second double of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the  left field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on Tom Prince is two-base passed ball.    The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second  being of the  bunt  variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a  foul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith  K had  to end any Pittsburgh hope.  Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor, Moeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings work.  Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played  bruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for  precautionary X-rays .  let us hope he has OK.  Cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the two wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar! Pittsburgh is now 7-6.  *********REDS FANS*************************** If you would like to receive this report on a  semi-daily basis (as often as I write it),  send me your e-mail address and i shall put you  on the list.
