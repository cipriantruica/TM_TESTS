This is an excellent question and i shall be anxious to see if there are any such cases.  I doubt it.  In the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent. when Aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone  knew the rules.   Today, when you cannot count on people knowing even the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric, a good argument is often indistinguishable from a poor one.
