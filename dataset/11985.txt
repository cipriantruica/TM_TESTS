From: harton@owlnet.rice.edu (Tracy Brian Harton) Subject: Wireless Transmitter/Receivers at RS   Does anyone know what frequencies the wireless transmitter/receiver microphone systems that Radio Shack sells operate at?  i have tried everything short of opening one up (not actually owning one makes this difficult...) and just looking..  Any help would be greatly appreciated..  These systems are designed for wireless PA systems, etc..     \t\t\t\t\tThanks, \t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tTracy
