You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z. we have implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking, set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough advertising.  I have not looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), i had say it will not be easy, since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it is roots back to X10).  The actual task to get the cursor to blink is not that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you shall have to show the cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused. Since it is a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you  do anything on screen anyways, this is not very complicated. you shall just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it is mapped.  As for the portability of emu and it is newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now, but unfortunately we are drowning in work. But since the changes are not affectiong emu is behavior much, i had say whoever wants to try emu should not wait for a new version.  As is, emu will not work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else  than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line of code). i shall put this on export today.
