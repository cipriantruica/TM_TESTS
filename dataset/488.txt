Only in heaven is there a dress code (black tie and self-important expression)  do not forget to sing:             They say there is a heaven for those who will wait                 Some say it is better, but I say it am not         i had rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints                      The sinners are much more fun                          Only the good die young!
