From: gel@cs.mcgill.ca (Gilles KHOUZAM) Subject: ATI Ultra Pro & Windows  Ok, I just got a new 486/66 16 Mb, with a ATI Ultra pro and I cannot get into windows. It says that I need more memory available, but I have 15mb ogf extended mem & 512k of conventionnal. I have disabled my memory aperture because it did not find any  FREE  memory, but it still gave me a message that the memory aperture will conflict with system memory. I think that is why it want to get in Windows.  Any help will greatly be appriciated.  Please Reply by mail, because this site is a week late on News   \t\t\t\t\tThanks  \t\t\t\t\tGel
