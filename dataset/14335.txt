From: zwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com (Michael Corvin) Subject: Re: HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days  Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and relaunching it:  (Caution: speculation mode engaged) There is another consideration that has not been mentioned yet. I expect that retrieving HST would involve  hadamaging\' it considerably in order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this might yield is that we could put new panels on that do not \'ring\' due to thermal cycle stresses...)  I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged (I assume that they were caged for launch)?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Corvin \t      \t\t\t\tzwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com GN&C R&D\t\t\t\t\tMartin Marietta Astronautics ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ===============    My views, not Martin Marietta is   ======================== -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
