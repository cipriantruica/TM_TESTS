From: strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) Subject: Re: New Encryption Algorithm   Arthur Melnick posts an interesting first-hand message about his NEA algorithm. Though I have no reason to disbelieve anything he says, I want to clarify one point:  He says he has no connection with the NSA. If he was part of an  NSA plot , of course he had say that.  Now I do not think he is. But the level of some discussion here is of that sort, and very quickly we reach the point where it is impossible to continue rationally discussing some issues.   I am not a crook    Well, if you were, of course you had say that    or the ever popular favorite:   Please prove the following negative.   I do not know what to do with such messages, so I have taken to ignoring them.  Comments?
