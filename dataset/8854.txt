Both have hung around for years, and continue to post great stats.  Why should not Dave Kingman get into the Hall?  Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others?  What the hell do you have to do?  Ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that Winfield should be in the hall...  God.  Pretty soon you shall be saying that Cal Ripken does not deserve to be in the Hall.  Then, i shall flame you. :-)      --  Chintan Amin  mail: llama@uiuc.edu ******************************Neil Peart, (c)1981***************************** * Quick to judge, Quick to Anger, Slow to understand, Ignorance and Prejudice* *And********Fear********Walk********************Hand*********in*********Hand *
