From: hugo@cats.ucsc.edu (Hugo Calendar) Subject: How universal are phones these days?   i am wondering if I can tote my American touch tone phone around with me to Sweden and Germany.  it is DC powered, and I can buy a special adapter for that in Europe.  The question is if the general electronics work the same.  I can buy a different wall plug and refit it (i am sure i had have to), but would that do the trick?  Thanks, Hugo
