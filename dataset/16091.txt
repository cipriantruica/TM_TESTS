Pardon me, here, but I do not trust Spectre is motives here at all.  Spectre was a major part of the Warren Commission, (remember the magic bullet theory?) and is NOT to be trusted if there is even the tiniest chance the guv\'mint may have done something wrong.  If he gets a chance i am afraid he will satisfy the public outcry with another whitewash.  <Unfortunately, if some of us get our wish and the BATF is disbanded or folded <into the FBI,  etc., we may end up with a  more efficient  agency than the <bumbling and competition we have today. Some agents should be fired. Some <should be prosecuted. But keep them as bumbling as possible -- we retain more <of our liberties that way. < Right on the money here.  We should certainly applaud the disbanding of the  BARTF but we must stress the personal responsibility of the goons who set up the assault on American citizens.    We must NOT count on Spectre, though, to get it done.
