From: gcdcrgm@state.systems.sa.gov.au Subject: PICLAB processing half a GIF  i have been playing with a program called PICLAB to modify some .gif files. The problem is it keeps displaying only 50% of the image. Starting from the top, it displays20%, leaves 20% blank, then down another 20% etc. ANyone know what i am doing wrong, or is there another piece of software I should use instead?  Thanks for your tolerance!
