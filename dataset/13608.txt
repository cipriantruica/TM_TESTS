Box 605 \tAmherst, NY 14226-0605       COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS      Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on     studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.  \t\t     (1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W\t    : crater diameter in km \t g  p  f  n  \t       (1/6)     S = (g /g )\t\t    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g\t  e  t\t\t      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g\tis the surface \t\t\t\t\t    e\t\t      t \t\t\t      gravity of the target body. This scaling is \t\t\t      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for \t\t\t      other bodies.  \t\t(1/3.4)     S = (p / p )\t    : correction factor for target density p  ,      p\t  a   t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    t \t\t\t      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U \t\t\t       a \t\t\t      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average \t\t\t      rock on the continental shields.      C\t\t\t    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km \t\t\t      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t    (1/3.4)     K\t\t\t    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)      n\t\t\t      empirically determined from the Jangle U \t\t\t      nuclear test crater.  \t      3\t\t   2\t\t       19     W = pi * d\t* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  ) \t\t\t    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent \t\t\t      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile \t\t\t      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3 \t\t\t      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.      An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.      More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):      Asteroid\t    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy     diameter (km)\t\t       (impacts/year)\t   (* 5*10^20 ergs)       10\t\t\t    10\t\t     10^-8\t\t10^9       1\t\t\t 1 000\t\t     10^-6\t\t10^6       0.1\t       100 000\t\t     10^-4\t\t10^3      assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT     equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.      References:      Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

It also has a very extensive reference \tlist covering essentially all of the reference material in the \tfield.]       MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY      Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the  Encyclopaedia     Brittanica , (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing     in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, 1990). The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder is USGS publication  Map Projections--A Working Manual , USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. it is a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one is $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,      An Album of Map Projections , USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and     tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.      A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,     (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call     them and tell them what you want. they will quote a price, you send a     check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up     for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.      A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:  \tR. Miller and F. Reddy,  Mapping the World in Pascal , \tByte V12   December 1987  \tContains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A \tdemo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data \tis available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.      Some references for spherical trignometry are:  \t_Spherical Astronomy_, W.M. Smart, Cambridge U. Press, 1931.  \t_A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy_, S.

INTERPRETING THE FITS IMAGE FORMAT      If you just need to examine FITS images, use the ppm package (see the     comp.graphics FAQ) to convert them to your preferred format. For more     information on the format and other software to read and write it, see     the sci.astro.fits FAQ.       SKY (UNIX EPHEMERIS PROGRAM)      The 6th Edition of the Unix operating system came with several software     systems not distributed because of older media capacity limitations.     Included were an ephmeris, a satellite track, and speech synthesis     software. The ephmeris, sky(6), is available within AT&T and to sites     possessing a Unix source code license. The program is regarded as Unix     source code. Sky is <0.5MB. Send proof of source code license to  \tE.

Convert parallax into distance using the     formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates     on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and     spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and     scale this by the distance.      Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog     (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or  The Catalogue of Stars within 25     parsecs of the Sun  (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on     ames.arc.nasa.gov).
