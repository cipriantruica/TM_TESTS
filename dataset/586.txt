Counterfeit atheists . Hmmmm. So, we are just cheap knock-offs of the True Atheists.   Religion demonstrates itself to be absurd. Constantly. Personally, if  someone asks, i am happy to point out how this is so.   > Rather than approach religion > (including Christainity) in a rational manner and debating its claims > -as the are stated-, atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then > hold the religious accountable for beliefs they do not have.

At least, READ NEWS: time-and-time again, we have hashed out the beliefs various religous doctrines hold.  Try debating reasonably with someone who makes a statement like,   ...more accurately oxymoric is the a term like, reasonable atheist.  Then take a look at the responses we have given Tammy. Seem pretty  reasonable , nay, even  polite  to me.   [accusations of myths a-flyin\'] >   > Here is a good example of of what I said above.

Then you do such an excellent job of spewing dogma that, well, the implication was pretty clear (if wrong, in this case).  [jeez, a misunderstanding.

Then report your findings about where it says the purpose of a.a is to find the \'truth\' of things.  And stop impressing your own misguided image of atheists upon us. it is really pissing me off.  >  > Bill
