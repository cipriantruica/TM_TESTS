From: wall@cc.swarthmore.edu (Matthew Wall) Subject: Rules on-line?  Well, i am finally about to key in the official rules for the archives, but before I do, I will ask again...  does anybody have the official MLB rules in electronic format?  Just trying to save myself a ton of work...no, they do not scan well because of the ridiculous format they are printed in.  thanks  - Matt    Matt Wall * wall@cc.swarthmore.edu * Hey, I gotta job here, OK? --------------------------------------------------------------- April 6, 1993: Boston Red Sox seize first place.
