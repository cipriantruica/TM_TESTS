From: adrian@tasman.cc.utas.edu.au (Adrian Lewis) Subject: cleaning electronic equipment?  Hi, \tJust a quick question.  What standard lab solvents can be used to clean electronic equipment and components safely (ie not corrode, dissolve, short-out, etc the equipment)? \twater?\t:-) \tmethanol? \tCCl4? \tetc? I am not an electronics type (surprise, surprise), and I want to avoid using freons.  Thanks,\t\tAdrian
