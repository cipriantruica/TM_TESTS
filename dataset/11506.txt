If it is not at one of    the receiptants location, forget encryption at all.  You have blown any    security you thought you might have had.   Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are military (or equivalent, like CIA and other embassy personnel), so putting bridges on the recipient is location is normal - it is in a vault on a military base or Ft. Meade, and the secure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors because they are talking about Classified Stuff (or Golf with Other Generals.)  That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob; most people do not use sound-proof vaults, and may use bridges in their PBX or from the local phone company (3-way calls) or Long Distance or value-added phone company (e.g. Alliance conference bridges).  If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones, the conferencing aspects do not change.  But there may be a market niche for trusted conference-bridge providers, though I suppose the inquisitors would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges, just in case a Bad Guy might use the service. --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
