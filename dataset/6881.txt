I grew up in New York City so I rode in many Checker cabs.  The jump seats were fun as a kid.  Although the cars were roomy -- a good trait for a taxi -- they had a design flaw that I do not understand they never fixed: the rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when the driver braked.  I would not want to take a long ride in the back seat of one of these vehicles.  Why did you like yours?  I never drove one, so I have to ask. --  Tommy Reingold AT&T Bell Labs, Holmdel, NJ tommy@boole.att.com or att!boole!tommy
