It seems to happen with large Makefiles. The entries near the end get lost. Small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem, as it does in your example.  In the MIT R5 distribution + R5.SunOS5.patch this can happen with the target ``Makefiles\'\' in one of the doc directories.  >At first I thought this was a bug with make on my Sun, but I built and used gnumake with the >same results. Attached you shall find the first Makefiles target rule from the generated makefile  This is really weird. Are your *really* sure that you were using GNU make?  Casper
