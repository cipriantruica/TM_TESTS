Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during World War II.  If you are prepared to say  let us round these people up and stick them in a concentration camp without trial , it is only a short step to gassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originally only intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly because they could not afford to run the camps because of the devastation caused by Goering is Total War.  Those who were not gassed generally died of malnutrition or disease.   mathew
