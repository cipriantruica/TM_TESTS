From: jzawodn@bgsu.edu (Jeremy D. Zawodny) Subject: Help needed in setting up NCSA Telnet w/ AppleTalk or Phonenet...   Okay, i am trying to install NCSA telnet on a couple (okay, a whole bunch) of machines.  they are all true blue IBMs with either Fallon Phonenet cards or Dastar cards.  (I belive those names are correct.)  Well, the docs for telnet say that it shall run over an AppleTalk driver, but i have had little success.  If anyone has succesfully installed Telnet w/ AppleTalk, i had like some help with the config file for Telnet...  BTW, please reply via E-mail if possible...  Thanks,  Jeremy  --  Jeremy Zawodny | Computer Science Undergrad | Bowling Green State University ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ jzawodn@andy.bgsu.edu | Student Computer Consultant | *thrilled* OS/2 2.0 user
