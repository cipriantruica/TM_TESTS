A  player is batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year. A player is ability to walk or infielder is Defensive Average are correlated better.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they will do next year.  Put in  some simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of  the basic problems with something like  clutch  batting average - overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero.  Adding to the sample size does not seem to help much.  As a counterexample to  what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:                 Non-Clutch                      Clutch                AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA   Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307 Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223  If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those  clutch  situations, you had bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in  1988, Maldonado hit .267 in  non-clutch  and .190 in  clutch , while Lemon hit .254 in  non-clutch  and .313 in  clutch .  Before you accuse me of  completely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+  clutch  at bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple measure of clutchness, let us just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use  \'84-\'87 to predict \'88 for those 96 players, you had find that 27 of the 96 were below league average in that measure both in \'84-87 and in \'88, 26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were  above in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins, you had expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment is not statisically significant.  BTW, correlating players\' _overall_ batting average from \'84-\'87 with \'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at something better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their (clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of  0.088, significant at no level of any interest.  > > >>       Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand  >>\tslam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three >>\tis a VERY clutch hit.

No way.           >  Actually, it is technically incorrect to say that we cannot predict future clutch performance.  it is more correct to say that we cannot predict future clutch performance with any skill.
