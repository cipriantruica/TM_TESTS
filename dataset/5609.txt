From: mlt@blues.infores.com (Michael Turok) Subject: \'makedepend\' problem  Hi, netters:  We have a problem with \'makedepend\': it does not know how to correctly process  if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are. For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed by Sun) - namely Xos.h:   if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__)         include          define  index   strchr         define  rindex  strrchr     /* BSD && !__STDC__ */         include   endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */  Here \'makedepend\' evaluates both  if and corresponding   statements to \'true\' and tries to open the file  which does not exist under Solaris2. We also have a lot of  if statements in some of our legacy code. We got and built \'makedepend\' off the net - it did not fix the problem.  In all fairness it should be noted that \'makdepend\' man-page (Sun is distribution) mentions this problem:  BUGS      If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C      preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way      that all  if directives will evaluate to   true   regardless      of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong  include      directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have      its own parser written for  if expressions.  Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to \'makdepend\' other than WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us?  Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply  directly to my e-mail address -> i shall post a summary.  Thanks in advance. *************************************************************************** *     Michael Turok                  *                                    * *  Information Resources, Inc.       * E-Mail:  mlt@blues.infores.com     * *     200 Fifth Avenue               * Voice:  (617) 890 1100 ext.7531    * *  Waltham, MA 02154, USA            * Fax:    (617) 890 4660             * ***************************************************************************
