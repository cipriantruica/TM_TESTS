From: icop@csa.bu.edu (Antonio Pera) Subject: Hockey & The Hispanic community   \tRelying on Canadian tourists and transplanted Northeasterners to support a team in Miami is crazy; espaecially when you have really deserving  cities without a team such as San Diego & Milwaukee. I wish the Panthers or whatever their name is well but if they cannot sell to Hispanics, they are in deep doo-doo. Already, there are rumors that Tampa may move to Milwaukee.
