Uh, oh.  I do not want an owner that\'ll keep everybody on >edge - i had never gotten that feeling about him, but who knows?  Does      To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner.  He has brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I do not think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team as he has already admitted that he does not know a whole lot about baseball. McLane is a businessman, and does not like excuses.  He makes a valid point that injuries should not be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  we are dealing with a young Houston team, so injuries should not play a big role.  The only threat is the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.  --- --- --- --- --- ---  David S.
