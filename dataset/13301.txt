Sheesh.  Mary Allison exclaims: MA> EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!! MA> Why cannot people learn to cook from scratch *ON* the net.  MA> i have gotten LOTS of recipes off the net that do not use additives.  Because one simply _cannot_ cook on the net, nor can one cook while ON the net.  Cooking is best done IN a kitchen, ON a stove.  (Gotcha! *grin*)  (I said this out of general frustration at people (not anyone in particular)  who seem to expect packaged food to conform to their tastes.  In other  words, if packaged foods are not to your liking, prepare foods that are.)  MA> If you LIKE additives then get off the net and go to your local MA> supermarket, buy lots of packaged foods, and YOU get OFF THE NET!!  I do not have strong feelings about additives, as long as I cannot taste \'em.  (As for the rest of your reply to me, I am sorry it it seemed as if i was   picking on you.  I was not trying to do so.  Please accept my apologies.)  ~ Kiran
