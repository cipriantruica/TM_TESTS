From: oueichek@imag.fr (Ibaa Oueichek) Subject: Cache card for IIsi  \ti am looking for a Cache card for my IIsi. I can spend $250 Max for it, \twhat i need is 64 kb cache with a fpu socket and a dual slot adapter. \tOr at least a passe_through connector so i can keep my graphic card. \tI need your advice about the best card i can buy. How much performance \tincrease i should expect, does the performance increase between the \t32 and 64 kb Cache worths the price difference ?. And what is the best \tprice i can get for such a card (i really need to spare each possible \t$).  \tI have an Ethernet card for the LC with fpu. I do not think it would \twork for the IIsi but the fpu is socketed. Do you think i can take the \tfpu out of the card and put it in the empty fpu socket ?. Would it work \tat 20 Mhz ?. If not, how much should i pay for an extra fpu ?.  -- Sham(u) ya tha (s)seif(u) lam yaghib(i) | Ibaa Oueichek. oueichek@imag.imag.fr     Ya jamal(al) majd(i) fi(l) kutub(i) |Lab de Genie Informatique (LGI).
