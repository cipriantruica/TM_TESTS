Yeah yeah yeah... and sure would be nice if we did not apply the death penalty disproportionately to minorities.  i shall revisit my opinion on the death penalty when there are more whites up for it than blacks.  I.e., when hell freezes over.  --- C J Silverio\tcj@sgi.com\tceej@well.sf.ca.us  The people causing the trouble were socialists and homosexuals, the typical sort of person who opposes us.   --Don Treshman,  ex-Klansman, leader of the  pro-life  group Rescue America,  on BBC TV, 2 April 1993.
