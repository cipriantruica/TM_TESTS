From: by028@cleveland.freenet.edu (Gary V. Cavano) Subject: Pantheism & Environmentalism  Hi...  i am new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already, but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into pantheism?  i have debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous.  As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all things!), April 2 (Editorial page):  We suspect that is because one party to the (environmental) dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  it is clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions.   (EMPHASIS MINE).  Thoughts?  Reactions?  Harangues?
