From: rtparies@b8.b8.ingr.com (Randy Paries) Subject: :Help with XClearArea  Hi,  \tCould some please tell me the errors of my ways.  \tI am trying to update a drawable. This drawable  \thappens to be a Pixmap on a button.  \t \tThe problem is that after I do the : XClearArea(XtDisplay(m_usr[0]),XtWindow(m_usr[0]), 80, 8, 40, 40, True);  \tThis appears to work. I then do  sprintf(tmp_str, R=%d ,++fun); XDrawString(XtDisplay(m_usr[0]), bmaps[0] ,my_gc, 78, 10, tmp_str, (strlen(tmp_str)) );  \tThe problem is that the new info is drawn but the old info is \tstill there. Even if I pass XClearArea a False and see it clear \twhen it redraws the new info, the old info is still there.   Help Please!!!
