From: dozier@utkux1.utk.edu (Anni Dozier) Subject: SOC.RELIGION.CHRISTIAN  After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months, it  has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with  Liberals, Catholics, New Agers\', and Athiests.  Someone might think  to change the name to:  soc.religion.any   - or -  perhaps even soc.religion.new.  It might seem to be more appropriate. Heck, do not flame me, i am Catholic, gay, and I voted  for Bill Clinton.  i am on your side!
