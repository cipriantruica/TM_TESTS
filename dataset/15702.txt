Politicians are generally whores to public opinion.  This does NOT mean the the public is either well informed or correct. As for the stats,  anyone can support anything with the right stats.  The   right  stats, from what i have seen, are sometimes even used to support conflicting sides of the same issue.   >> How do you intend to  isilence\' RKBA supporters? > >\tTalk all you want.

While armed insurrection, as the FF is of the Const.  may have envisioned seems to me a somewhat fanatical approach to avoiding this, Political protest is still an option at this point.  I agree that it is  argueably not enough and/or too late.  If all else fails, there is always PVC pipe and cosmoline.  --  Chris Miller chris@MorningStar.Com  My opinions are my own (obviously), and by definition do not reflect the opinions of anyone else...
