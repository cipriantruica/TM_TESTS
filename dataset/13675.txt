I think  most NASA food products were designed to be low fiber \'zero-residue\' products so as to minimize the difficulties of waste disposal.  i had doubt they would deploy anything that caused whole sale GI distress.  There are not enough plastic baggies in the world for a bad case of GI disease.  pat
