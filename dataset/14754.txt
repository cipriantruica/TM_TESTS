Jim,  Please feel free to correct me and give me some texts.  As far as I can see the only text which vaugely relates to jewish evangelism is found in Mt. 23:15. However since this is found only in Mt. it cannot be dated before 90CE which makes it unusefull for understanding Second Temple Judaism.   randy
