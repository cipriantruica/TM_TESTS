From: especkma@reed.edu (Erik. A Speckman) Subject: What is   ROM accelerated video ?  In the MacUser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned that the C650 and the Q800, and not the C610, had ROM accelerated video.  It did not seem to make much difference in their  benchmark  test.  What is it?  I do not recall seeing it in Dale Adams post.  -Erik Speckman  P.S.  could someone tell me if Dale is posts on video and memory are archived somewhere.
