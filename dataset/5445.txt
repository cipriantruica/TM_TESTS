From: lee sq.sq.com (Liam R. E. Quin) Subject: OPEN LOOK GUI frequently asked questions   Frequently-asked questions about the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface.  If your question is not here, please try (at *least*) \tman openwin \tman xnews \tman 7 xview and looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the Bibliography below before posting to the comp.windows.open-look, comp.windows.x or alt.toolkits.xview newsgroups and/or their corresponding mailing lists.  Special Notes:     * I have not updated this FAQ for the recently-announced OpenWindows 4,       due to ship later this year.     * Yes, Sun is moving to Motif, along with all of COSE.  But the Motif to       which they move will be a new Motif, with some of the OPEN LOOK UI       features added.     * Yes, OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS.  NeWS is dead.       This means TNT is dead, too.     * XView and OLIT will be supported, but probably not enhanced after the       next release.  I do not know if there will be a source release of       XView 3.1 or not.     * The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun is DeskSet,       ported to Motif.  Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool, at least.     * Yes, the new Mailtool will be MIME-compliant.  Frequently Asked Questions for X11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly.

OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).     A GUI determines the `look and feel\' of a system -- the shape of     windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you     edit files, etc.      The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified, developed and maintained jointly by     Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?).      See Also: \tBibliography    What is OpenWindows?     OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK     Graphical User Interface Specifications.  it is compatible with the     X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun is NeWS and SunView,     so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.     It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.     OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the     program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.     It should not be called `Windows\' or \'OPEN LOOK\' or `OpenLook\', as     these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.     A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,     plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.     The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are: \tSunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0 \tSolaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0 \tSolaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1      See Also: \tMixing X11 and OpenWindows \tWhere can I get it?    What are OLIT, XView and TNT?     These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs     that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography     for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here is a brief summary:      OLIT was AT&T is OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;     it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were     already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,     although you did not get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the     OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in     System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in     OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a     division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).     Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably     want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or     anything else that uses subclasses.     [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]      XView is Sun is toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in     programmer interface to SunView.  there is even a shell script to help     migrate source code from SunView to XView.\t XView is often said to be     the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.     The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is     available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).     The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.     Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the     XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be     included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.     On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much     attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.      The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based     on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the     OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of     an application.  it is currently included in OpenWindows.      The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some     incompatibilities with `tNt\' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to     supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time     later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.     You might ask what `is committed to\' means in this context; the     answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.     Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.      The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++     class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from     DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify     event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be     compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the     release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.     UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of     various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in     the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).    Where does Motif fit in?     It does not :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that     is being developed by OSF.\tIt has a `look and feel\' reminiscent of     Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-     commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold     reasonably cheaply by OSF.\tAlthough Motif is currently available on     more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly     used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a     large installed base.     Sun is CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif     applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in     the `Periodic Table\' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.    What is MoOLIT?     MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between     a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V     Release 4.2.     Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo usl.com, (908) 522-6677    What about that Display PostScript thing?     Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X     in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed     hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a     very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously     being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it     has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less     complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.     Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;     what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.     Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS     extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to     ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.     (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts     available, however)  Subject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm    What are olwm and olvwm?     They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window     system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows     on the screen, and for managing the user is interaction with the windows.      Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.     it is included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and     you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.      Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop\' (hence the     `v\' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the     currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.\t You can     move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This     lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around     from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm     by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.     Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib     directory; there are three patches).    Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?     Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you will not be able to use     the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) will not see the     footers some windows use to display certain messages.      If you use twm, you shall want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus     and get rid of programs that do not have a `quit\' button when not run     under olwm.     For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc: \tLeftTitleButton  target  = f.delete     where  target  is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.     Alternatively, try \t  Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm \tLeftTitleButton  :menu  = f.menu  OL.menu   \tmenu  OL.menu  { \t     Quit          f.delete \t}      For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title     bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).      See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).  Subject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays    Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?     The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.     This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.     Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS     or SunView support, and thus will not run on an X terminal.  This includes     pageview in particular.      You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-     Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)     will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about     fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.     If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you     may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal is     XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.   Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows         What configuration files do I need to know about?      .xinitrc and .xsessionrc      The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in     your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to     edit it somewhat; it is simplest to move it and any other old X11 files     you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.      If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,     since xdm does not look at your .xinitrc file.      .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys      These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,     depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.     Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files     without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need     to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an     X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,     shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano is  contool  program so that     system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.     Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.      .Xdefaults      You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,     it is a good idea to include at least: \tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:\ttrue \t*Input: TRUE     These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they     forget to ask for it.      Props, the program that runs when you select `properties\' from the default     root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.     do not put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props\' deletes them.      .startup.ps      This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)     on startup.\t This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the     back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change     the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a     syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up     at all or will get broken in strange ways.\tThe NeWS manual gives code     that is both incorrect and insufficient.     WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.      Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see     the man page for xset ( man xset , and  xset -help ) for more information.      Here is what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of     about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of     twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for     OpenWindows 3.  you shall have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime     is the delay between keys sent, and thus does not include the time to     process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your     SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...  \t% do not want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual \t% /IncludeDemos? false def  \tUserProfile begin \t    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def \t    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def \t    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly... \tend      You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:  \t/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage \t/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage \t/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage  \tClassRepeatKeys pop\t% force repeat.ps to autoload  \tendpackage endpackage endpackage      If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the     OpenWindows server like this: \t$ psh -i .startup.ps \tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3 \t$ psh -i \tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3 \t/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send \t%%% now press control-D      You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make     the root window be  retained , so that a PostScript drawing on the     background will not be erased when you move windows: \tframbuffer /Retained true put     will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used     by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.          See also: \tTrouble Shooting: It will not Let Me Type \tTrouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults? \tEnvironment Variables    How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?     You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one     or two occasional surprises.  See also  man 7 xview  for a list of     keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.      With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings     and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should     tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this     in your .xinitrc:      if eval `svenv -env`     then \txmodmap -e  pointer = 1 2 3  \tinput_from_defaults     else \txmodmap -e  pointer = 3 2 1      fi     How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?      Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it is a boring but     effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank\'.     Under Solaris 2 you shall need to copy screenblank from an older system, as     it is not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system     run screenblank automatically.  Subject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste    How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?      To go from XTerm to textedit (say):     * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button       in xterm     * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O\'Reilly       XView manual gets this wrong)     * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)      If this does not work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste     To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:     * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY     * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).     * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.    COPY/PASTE is boring.\t What short-cuts are available?      Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:     * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go     * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button     * Select the text you want to copy/move.  you shall see that it is underlined       or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)     * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.     * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.      Drag and Drop to Move a Selection     * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-       clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button     * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection     * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse       pointer a little to the right; you shall see the cursor changes to be the       first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).     * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want       to drop the text     * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show       that it is OK to drop things here     * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.\tThis works in text fields of       dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.      Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection     * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that       you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.    What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?      See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.     In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when     shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the     right of the insert point.  \tMeta-i - include file\t    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)  \tCtrl-a - start of line\t    Ctrl- - forward word \tCtrl-w - delete word\t    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line \tCtrl-Return - move to end/START of document      See the O\'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default     keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.    What can I put in my .ttysrc?\t Where is it documented?      See the manual page for shelltool.  Subject: Applications: Finding Out...     Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,     which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_     Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.      Sun is free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular     OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor     concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full     product documentation.      SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer is Pallate, which     contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as     well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.      There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists     a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee sq.com for a     copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a     faster reply.  Subject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc.    Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?     Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.     If  man cm_delete  does not work or gives strange messages, see under     Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.    How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?     The best way is:     $ cd     $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .     $ chmod +w .textswrc     edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)     add the follwing: \tKEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER \tcat ~/.signature     (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)      Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.    Subject: Fonts    Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts?     Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (i am not sure which).     Or, Not Yet, in other words.      If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, i am told.     The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and     comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is     interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the     Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on     the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.      You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably     other major foundries.      SunPICS\' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.    Improving font rendering time     Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it is not as     fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes     that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache     parameters.\t If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the     font cache size. \t$ psh -i \tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3 ./Bembo20.fb \tChars parameter greater than number of characters supplied. \t$ ls \tBembo20.afb\tBembo20.fb\tSynonyms.list \t$ bldfamily \t* Bembo\t\t       ./Bembo.ff (Encoding: latin) \tcat: ./Compat.list: No such file or directory \t$ xset +fp `pwd` \t$ xset fp rehash      If you want the server to see your new font directory every time,     add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one     of your start-up files, e.g. .login or .profile.    Converting between font formats (convertfont, etc.)     You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server, by converting them to a     bitmap (X11 bdf format) first.  Your licence forbids you from using the     fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you should not     use them for printing.  Having said all that...  you can use makeafb and     convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or     bdftopcf.      Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to     X11 bdf format, which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows.      You can also use der Mouse is  getbdf  to get bdf fonts from a running     X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf    Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi     There are not any.  More precisely, the various text fonts, such as     Lucida Typewriter Sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are     scalable under OpenWindows.\t The glyph fonts are bitmaps, and do not     scale very well.  Subject: Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages    No manual entry for cm_lookup      If man does not seem to find OpenWindows commands, even though you are     running OpenWindows, try setting the MANPATH environment variable: \tMANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH     or \tsetenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man     for csh users.  $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems.    window: Window creation failed to get new fd    window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment    Cannot create base frame.  Process aborted.       These messages all come from SunView programs.  SunView was an     earlier windowing system for Suns, and was not networked.  Some of     the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin, and have names     that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts.  You almost     certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead.      Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for     OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin, they are the same), or     you shall get the SunView versions of mailtool, cmdtool, shelltool, etc.    memory fault - core dumped     If you get this from the binder, or if binder vanishes suddenly,     get the following patches: \t100493-02 Binder \t100524-03 Cetables \t100626-03 Tooltalk    Trouble compiling Xt, Xmu or OLIT programs: _get_wmShellWidgetClass       If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), contact your local     Sun office and request the following patches: 100512-02   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu      If you cannot install the patch, a workaround is to add  \t-u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass     on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line.  An alternative is to add \t-assert nodefinitions     to CFLAGS in your Makefile, or even in Imake.tmpl.   Subject: Trouble Shooting: It will not Let Me Type    When I try to type into some programs, I just get beeps or nothing happens     It is a good idea to include at least: \tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:\ttrue \t*Input: TRUE     in your .Xdefaults file, as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to     receive input even if they forget to ask for it.     See the next item for editing .Xdefaults  Subject: Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste not working    I cannot paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs     Under OpenWindows 2, you need to add the following either to your     $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead:  \tXTerm*VT100.Translations:  override   \t\tL6:select-set(CLIPBOARD) n  \t\tL8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)        You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing     L8 (the Paste key)!      Under OpenWindows 3, this is already in the app-defaults file, so if it     is not working, check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to \t/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S     and if it is not, either set it or copy/merge the above lines from     $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.     [See also: Environment Variables]      This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard: \tXTerm*VT100.translations:  override n  \t    ~Ctrl ~Meta: insert-selection(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0) n  \t    ~Ctrl ~Meta: select-end(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0,CLIPBOARD) n  \t    L8: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)     [Note: be sure that the  n  is at the very end of the line, there must      be no following spaces, and any + or | signs showing that this FAQ file      was altered must also be removed!]      If you are using X11R5, you may find that adding the lines L10: start-extend() select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0) n         L10: kill-selection()  n     before the L8 line will make L10 (CUT) work as a cut key!      If you alter $HOME/.Xdefaults instead, you must use what X calls a     `more specific\' resource name: \txterm.vt100.translations     will do.    I cannot paste from XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs to xterm      If you do not have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard, you can     use Meta-x, Meta-c and Meta-v for cut, coy and paste respectively.     You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to     your .Xdefaults file, edited as you wish (the values shown here are the     defaults):  \tOpenwindows.KeyboardCommand.Copy: c+Meta,L6 \tOpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Paste ,  v+Meta,L8          Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview, and also in the     thinnish blue book `Companion to Volume 7, XView Reference Manual\' from     O\'Reilly, and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages.    I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE (L8, Meta+v)     Remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that helps; see also the     next item.    Cut Copy and Paste do not work at all (OpenWindows only)     Oh dear.  Use ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running     and that either you or root started it, depending on whether you started     OpenWindows with  openwin  or by logging in through xdm.     If not, start it.  If it dies, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc     before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it, or you can     reboot your workstation.     Check that there is space in /tmp (use  df /tmp ), and also see if there     are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are     several hundred of them, cut and paste may take so long that it times out.      Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start     a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files     that are still there.  it is simplest to quit openwin and start it again     after doing that, if cut and paste was broken, but if it starts working     again you can just carry on.  Note that files in /tmp not owned by you     might be in use by another worker comrade, so do not remove those without     checking first!  Subject: Trouble Shooting: Not authorized to use display      If you get error messages that look like \tXlib:  connection to  :0.0  refused by server \tXlib:  Internal error during connection authorization check \tError: cannot Open display     try, on the machine running OpenWindows or X11, \txhost +machine     where  machine  is the computer on which you ran the command that failed.     If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you,     using your display, you will have to type the bizarre-looking \txhost +`hostname`     (or xhost +happyboy, if happyboy is the name of your workstation).     This lets ANY user on `happyboy\' access your display.      With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the Programmer is Guide      describes how to do this in Chapter 8, p. 101.  This is more secure.     Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the     framebuffer directly!      Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1     to fix a serious security problem.  It is available through your local     Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net     [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist:     Fix                     PatchID        Filename            Checksum     loadmodule              1076118        100448-01.tar.Z     04354  5       On an X Terminal, there may be a setup menu that lets you change or     disable the list of hosts that can access the display.      If you start getting this message after you have been logged in overnight,     there might be a cron job that is removing the Unix sockets in /tmp     that are used to communicate with the server when $DISPLAY does not have     a hostname before the :, or is empty.  Have the system administrator     change the cron script to skip sockets.  Subject: Trouble Shooting: other common problems    I get console error messages on my screen and they do not go away (Sun 3 or 4)     If  refresh  makes the messages vanish, but new ones come along later, \tyou need to run  xterm -C  from your .xinitrc, or start one up in \tthe background and then  choose Save Workspace from the \tWorkspace->Utilities menu.  Better still, pick up  contool  and run \tthat.  Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory.  It \twill monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a \tmessage appears; it is very easy to configure.      If  refresh  from the Workspace->Utilities menu does not make the messages,     go away... \ta Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the \tmouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto \ta whole new (but monochrome) display, called  :0.1 .  See the man. \tpage for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and, \tif there is a /dev/cgfour0, does \t\topenwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0 \tIf you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2, you might need to add this \tto your .xinitrc or other startup file: \t( \t    eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env` \t    olvwm -display unix:0.1 \t) & \tLater releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically. \tYou can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also, see \tthe note about contool, above.    Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults?     Use `props\', which appears in the default root menu as `properties\'.     This starts `props\', a property editor which will re-write your     .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.     Keep comments by using  comment.  instead of  ! , for example, \tcomment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37    How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit?     set the default editor to \tsh -c  exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18   $FILE        (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one)    How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video?     This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.\t With OpwnWindows 3.0,     there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options.  If you are     using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of     upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.    Why do not flat check-boxes work?     A known bug may make Guide is output dump core if you use these.     A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it is only Guide is output     that is broken, not the actual check-box code.     This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you are     still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;     the new one is fantastic!    When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays   on the screen.     Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in     the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin\').    When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.     This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to     use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.        Why have some of my function keys stopped working?     Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37     respectively in OpenWindows 3.  Applications must be recompiled, or you     might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to     change your keyboard layout back again.    When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, I get the Sunview version     See under  Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages  below.      (see also next item)    Mixing X11 and OpenWindows     (see also next item)      Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch     level 18), but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to     OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with     OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.      Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.\tYou can intermix OpenWindows     and X11R4 or X11R5, they are all compatible in this respect.     Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.      Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions     of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a     matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory     first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have     /bin (or /usr/bin, they are the same directory on SunOS) earlier in     your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you shall get SunView programs instead     of OpenWindows ones!      Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11     library directory.\tThis does not matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with     older versions you shall get error messages from X11 programs if you do not     do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although     xdm core dumps if this is not right.      Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it is not     /usr/openwin.      See Also: \tEnvironment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).    I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found     set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use \t     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib     If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use     ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for     /bin/sh; for csh it is different.    I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero     Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches     and install the patch.    Why does not AnswerBook run for me?     You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.\tIt will not run under     X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw     the PostScript text and pictures.     If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0     compatible navigator; it is called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.     If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace     navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to     satisfy your sense of paranoia!)     The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.     Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with     a PostSript viewer (q.v.).    Why are not there any fish in realxfishdb?     A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from     ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z    Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?     It is not implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties     Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.    File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool     Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it is fine.  It also     works if you run command tool on a remote machine.     Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.    When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red!     Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be     selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted     in red (the `Red Stain\') to show that it has the input focus.     To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file: \t*traversalOn: off \t*TextEdit.traversalOn: on \t*TextField.traversalOn: on     You can change the color using (for example) \t*InputFocusColor: grey50 \t*input*FocusColor: green \t*List*inputFocusColor:      See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set     Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation.     Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the     OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch.    When I run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when   I move into a different window! ( colormap flashing )          This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.     However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure:     *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.     *  Run \tcmap_compact save        to create the .owcolors file     *  Put the line \tcmap_compact init        near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)     *  Exit and then restart the window system.     *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of \tthe colormap and reserves them.      Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and     Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page.    pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above):     This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif     window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows.     Try running pageview like this: \t$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono \t$OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview \t$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard    XDM breaks things     Command tool does not like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal\'.     Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.     SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in \tsvenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic     because xdm will not set the necessary environment variables.     Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security     hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your     users can access files and start Unix processes ass root...    Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working     In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names ( keysyms ) for these keys was changed     to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.\t Code which uses them should be recompiled,     or you might be able to get away with \txmodmap -e \'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36\'  Subject: Trouble Shooting: XView problems     This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears, which has been     promised, but has not reached here.\tNote that there is also a usenet     newsgroup, alt.toolkits.xview, although it does not sem to have very     wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles     per month.\tYou should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x.    how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items?     PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle.     PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles.     There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font.     You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you     insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function     insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits.    how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed?     In the button callback, do         xv_set(button, PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS, XV_ERROR, NULL);     This will keep the window visible.     You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute.    how do I make an XView button look pressed?     call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are     documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source...    OpenWindows 3 imake does not work properly     Here is Greg Earle is patch, to be applied in $OPENWINHOME; note that you     should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and     OSMinorVersion right (MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2, for example).

MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form.      OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun, or you can get the source from     Interactive Systems Inc.  It is also included in some vendors\' System V     Release 4 implementations, although that is not always the latest version.     The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures     is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0.     Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as     the windowing system for Solaris.      There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either     available now or in progress.  Unfortunately, none of them seem to     be available from anywhere.

Thomas Van Raalte]  \tThe Companion to Volume 7 is an expanded version of the Attribute \tSummary from the previous edition of the XView Programming Manual, \ttogether with other reference information, so that in practice you \thave to buy both books.  \tO\'Reilly also have a thinnish orange book on the differences between \tX11R4 and RX115.  \tOLIT programmers will also want the Xt books - volumes 4 and 5. \tThere is a new big fat green Vol 5 updated for X11R5.  \tA journal, The X Resource, may also be of interest.  \tO\'Reilly & Associates, 103 Morris Street, Suita A, Sebastopol, CA 95472 \t+1 707 829-0515, or, in the USA and Canada only, 1-800-998-9938 \tFax: +1 707-829-0104. \tEmail nuts ora.com or uunet!ora!nuts. \tFor other distributors: mail, FAX, or call +1 707-829-0515.      Some of the O\'Reilly examples are available fro ftp from     export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib/OReilly directory.      The System V Release 4 Documentation from Prentice Hall may also include     a section on OpenWindows.      David Miller describes programming with OLIT in his \t`An OPEN LOOK At Unix\' (M&T press).          Nabajyoti Brkakati gives an excellent introduction to X and to OLIT     programming, as well as setting up and using X and OpenWindows, in: \t`Unix[R] Desktop Guide to OPEN LOOK\' \tSAMS, 1992  ISBN 0-672-30023-0 \tYou can get the examples from this book as \t    export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/naba-olguide-examples.tar.Z      Also about using OLIT, and Xt in particular: \tThe X Window System: Programming and Applications with Xt, \tOPEN LOOK Edition, \tDoug Young and John Pew, Prentice Hall, 1992, \tISBN 0-13-982992-X     There are also HP Widgets and Motif (ugh) versions of this book.     The example source code in this book can be obtained by ftp from     export.lcs.mit.edu, file  contrib/young.pew.olit.Z .      There is an introduction to XView in \t`Writing Applications For Sun Systems\', Vol 1, `A Guide for \tMacintosh(R) Programmers\' (Sun Microsystems, pub. Addison Wesley)          To learn more about the NeWS and PostScript languages, see  \tThe NeWS Book, Springer Verlag, 1989 (sadly, a little out of date)  \tPostScript Language Reference Manual, Second Edition, \tAdobe Systems Inc., Addison Wesley, 1990 [ the Red Book ] \t    Note that OpenWindows 3 is a level 1 PostScript implementation, \t    with certain Level 2 features (such as Composite Fonts) to some \t    degree. \t \tPostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook, \tAdobe Systems Inc., Addison Wesley, 1985 [ The blue book ]          there is at least one book on using Solaris (i.e. SunOS).      Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows,     although you may have to order it separately.  Here is what I have; they     are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than A4 paper), and vary from     about 1 cm to about 3cm thick.  They say `User is Guide\' or `Programmer is     Guide\' on the front.  The User manuals have a red stripe on the bottom,     and the Programmer ones have a green stripe.      800-6006-10 OpenWindows Version 3 Release Manual     800-6029-10 OpenWindows Version 3 Installation and Start-Up Guide     800-6231-10 OpenWindows Version 3 DeskSet Reference Guide     800-6618-10 OpenWindows Version 3 User is Guide     800-6323-10 Desktop Integration Guide [also available in bookstores?]     800-6027-10 Programmer is Guide     800-6005-10 OpenWindows Version 3 Reference Manual [the man pages]     800-6319-10 The NeWS Toolkit 3.0 Reference Manual     800-6736-10 NeWS 3.0 Programming Guide     800-6055-10 OLIT 3.0 Widget Set Reference Manual     800-6198-10 XView 3.0 Reference Manual: Converting SunView Applications      800-6854-10 F3 Font Format Specification [order separately]      There are also some other sets of documentation, including the TypeScaler     documentation from the OpenFonts group, for example.  There does not seem     to be a complete list anywhere.      ??????????? ToolTalk 1.0 Setup and Administration Guide (SunSoft, 1991)     800-6093-10 ToolTalk 1.0 Programmer is Guide (SunSoft, 1991)     There might be documentation about the Link Manager somewhere, too.      AT&T includes several large thorny bushes\' worth of paper with OLIT.      Sun is AnswerBook CD/ROM contains a lot of the above documentation,     including some of the O\'Reilly books (not the XView 3 Volume 7, though).      Volume 8 of the O\'Reilly series is about X Administration, and mentions     OpenWindows, although it is primarily aimed at X11R5.      Several other books are in the works...
