Please forgive all the inclusions. I suppose they are neccessary to follow the argument.  My point is that  if life has meaning or importance then we should try to find that meaning or importance  which is almost a tautology. (I hope i am not being too patronizing.) One term for that meaning is  Creator , though that is not obvious from my above argument.  >  And the logic is also appalling:  God must exist because I want Him to.

Unfortunately the term  religious  is ambiguous to me in this context. I could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being religious. I could say cult followers by definition have given up on  the search.  If you want  meaning  why not search for the truth?  So far, my understanding of Christianity is congruent with my understanding of truth. There have been many before me who have come to conclusions  that are worded in ways that make sense to me. By no means does that imply that I understand everything.   Chris Mussack
