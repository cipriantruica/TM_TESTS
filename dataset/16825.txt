With every Israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral bankruptcy of Israel is occupation and drawing attention to the Israeli government is policy of reckless disregard for civilian life.   \tApparently, the Hizbollah were encouraged by Brad is cheers \t(good job, Brad). Someone forgot to tell them, though, that  \tBrad asks them to place only Israeli _sons_ in the grave,  \tnot daughters.
