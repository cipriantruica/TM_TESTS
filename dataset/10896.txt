I have also been in contact with Mitch about this. I believe him when he says he did not ask to be on the  clipper  list.  He also forwarded the traffic he had recieved through that list to me which will be placed at some ftp site.  However, the first alias on the  clipper list  was csspab which was another mailing list. It basically contained the addresses for staffers and board members of the NIST security board. Several of these people had their accounts within the dockmaster domain.  These are the people we might wish to FOIA...  /harry --  Harry Shapiro  \t\t\t\t      habs@panix.com List Administrator of the Extropy Institute Mailing List Private Communication for the Extropian Community since 1991
