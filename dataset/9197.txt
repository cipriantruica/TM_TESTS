I really think that this is the key point.  When I saw the incident on Baseball Tonight Sunday, I could not believe how far away from the plate Gant went.  Then he casually leaned against his bat.  I do not blame the  umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.    The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the field.  What were they going to do, attack the umpire?  The only people who should have been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches, but NO players. I agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for having no control over his team.      John
