The problem is that Squids and BadAssBikers cannot recognize each other is waves.  When you are riding a cruiser, you  wave  by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without first removing that hand from the handlebar.  When you are riding a crotch rocket, you lower the left hand to about ankle level, palm forward, and call that a wave.  Generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely off the handlebar and wave it around, so it is easy to tell when they are waving.  --- chris
