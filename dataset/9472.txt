If it is working, you do not SCREW IT UP by changing things, just because you think it ought to be different.  Some folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams win. When the Giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange the batting order. Until then, I think it is stupid to focus on what is wrong, for the simple fact that IT\'S WORKING AS IT IS.  >P.S.  Does the mailing list maintainer think that Will Clark is the best  >first baseman in the majors and that Matt Williams is a better power hitter >than any other ballplayer?  In the majors? I do not follow AL, so I will not comment on  Majors . In the NL, if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it had be Clark, and i had hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, because i have never been able to GET Clark. i had take any of the three without hesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it).  Williams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he is not headcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops to .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest Baseball Weekly, he has hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296. that is not exactly chopped liver.  Mostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that continues, it is rather silly to second-guess their strategy. But evidently, some folks would rather be right than be first.   --   Chuq  IMHO  Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com    Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ    Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)   San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)
