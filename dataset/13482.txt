From: cindy@berkp.uadv.uci.edu (Cindy Windham) Subject: what is a bone scan?  My mother has been advised to have a bone scan performed?  What is this procedure for, and is it painful?  she is been having leg and back pain which her GP said was sciatica.  Her oncologist listened to her symptoms and said that it did not sound like sciatica, and she should get a bone scan.    - Cindy W.
