Precisely.  there is no objective medicine; some people get marvellous results from alternative therapy, others only respond to traditional medicine.  there is no objective physics; Einstein and Bohr have told us that.  there is no objective reality.  LSD should be sufficient to prove that.  > One wonders just what people who ask such questions understand by the term  >  objective , if anything.

Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string, it does not actually exist; but we can talk about things as if they were like it, and not be too far wrong.   mathew
