I think that the government own a stake.  Unfortunately they owned a stake of Jaguar too, until they decided to make a quick buck and sold it to Ford.  Bastards. This is definitely the ultimate Arthur-Daley government. --  Nick (the Cynical Biker)   DoD 1069   Concise Oxford   Leaky Gearbox  M\'Lud.
