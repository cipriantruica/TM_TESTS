From: wdh@grouper.mkt.csd.harris.com (W. David Higgins) Subject: \'93 Ford Probe GT -- Engine problems?  One of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) \'93 Probe GT on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the window saying the dealership bought the car back from the previous owner because of  Engine noises , but that the Ford district rep had OK\'ed the car saying those noises were  normal .  I thought it was worth looking into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story about her son is \'93 Probe GT, which had several problems, ending with engine noises which she said  was something with the heads , that Ford acknowledged the noise, said they were working on it, but did not have a cure as of yet.  Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not the same car).  So I have some evidence of a reoccuring problem with the V6 in the Probe GT is, and by extension with the Madza 626 and MX-6.  Anything to this?  i had love to consider buying the GT (i am turning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-) but i had hate to find out I just became the proud owner of a Lemon.
