From: moy@cae.wisc.edu (Howard Moy) Subject: How to fix Word subscript spacing?   Hi,  I have a problem when using subscripts with MSWord.  The problem is the subscripted characters get cut off on the display, but print out ok.  Anyone know how to fix the subscripts so I can see them on the screen?  Many thanks, --  -Howard _________________________________________________________ !                    Howard Moy\t\t\t\t! !                  (608) 255-6379\t\t\t!
