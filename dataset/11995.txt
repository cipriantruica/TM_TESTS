If you have an idea about its voltage and current  ratings, e.g. 60VDC   6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with  anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating  of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely  ON   at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they are more or  less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is  used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to  experiment with various gain-altering techniques.
