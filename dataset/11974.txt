From: kludge@grissom.larc.nasa.gov (Scott Dorsey) Subject: Mysterious MOSFET  I have a MOSFET pulled out of a Trygon power supply, for which I have no  manual.  it is a Motorola part with a 1972 date code and the number  \t\t285-4  which the Motorola folks assure me is a house number, which they cannot help me with.  Any suggestions from folks out there?  I cannot put it on a curve tracer to try to get an equivalent, since it is completely shot. --scott
