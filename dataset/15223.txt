The dogma of the Assumption does not state whether or not Mary died a physical death before being taken into Heaven.  Catholics are free to believe what they wish, whether it be that she was taken still alive, or after having died.  I lean somewhat toward the latter myself.  -\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t- Steve Creps, Indiana University creps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu
