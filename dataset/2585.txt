From: herrod@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Stephen Herrod) Subject: MEWIN Latex Help  I posted this to the apps group and did not get any response, so i shall try here. I am trying to use the latex help feature available in emacs for windows and read that you need a separate latexhlp.zip file along with a vms2hlp.zip file to convert this to windows help. Has anyone found these files or gotten this command help to work?  Thanks, Steve Herrod
