Chris Behanna is especially a squid.  A squid is the guy I saw back in December on cool 40 degree morning on my way to work. He was wearing knee-length pants, light jacket, no gloves, though he was going considerably slower than DoD nominal.  A POSER squid was the guy I saw yesterday on my way home.  Similar attire as above sans jacket (it is April in Texas ya know), but he is riding down the freeway, left hand on his side (kinda Robinhoodlike), with his body turned slightly left.  Brings a whole new meaning to the term POSER.
