From: edorn1@cc.swarthmore.edu (Evan Dorn) Subject: Please HELP!!  (Wierd Problem)  Somebody help me cure my poor computer before I go insane!  I have a problem with my 486 when running windows that appears to be memory-related.  it is actually not limited to windows, but that is where it causes most of my problems.  Ths machine is 486DX33, 8Meg RAM, 256Kcache, TRIDENT TVGA card, PAS-16 soundcard.  1)  Windows runs REALLY, REALLY slow most of the time.  Slower than on my old 386SX16.  Graphics draws/fills are slow, boots are slow, applications are sluggish, dialog boxes take up to 15 seconds to appear. (Note: some of my other non-windows applications do funny things that appear to be related.  Several run slow, my .mod player crashes the system etc..)  2) Running Borland C++ 3.0 before running windows (or any of the other programs)  COMPLETELY fixes the problem.  Windows will run as fast as i have ever seen it run, easily 10 times faster for graphics than when I do not run BC beforehand.  3)  I do not have a memory manager installed in config.sys.  Installing emm386.exe does not fix the problem- it makes it worse.  After emm386 is installed, running BC will not fix the problem anymore.  This problem is driving me nuts.  If you think you can help, please reply through the mail. Thanks, Evan
