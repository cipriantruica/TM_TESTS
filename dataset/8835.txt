April 15th... less than 30 at bats.... and you claim that he  has not done too much so far!  Cut this guy some slack. Danny will produce this year. it is scary to think just how much he shall produce if he were to stay healthy all year.  The Yanks have a lot going for them this year: good starting rotation, good bullpen, good defense and a good lineup. Also, I like Buck Showalter. Frank Howard on 1st is also a good move. Everything sounds good so far.   If the Yanks stay healthy, they have a good chance at winning the pennant. This  is the most fun i have had watching the Yanks since  78!  -Bobby
