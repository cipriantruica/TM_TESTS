So I have a question for you; here goes.  I come up to you and point a gun at you, saying  i am going to count to ten, if you are not standing on your head by then, i shall kill you.  You believe that standing on your head is the road to damnation, so you do not do it.  1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8..9..10...BANG!   You are now dead - Is it my fault for shooting you, or you are fault for being shot? Koresh would not stand on his head.    -Aaron
