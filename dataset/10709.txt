If the clipper does not impose any unfortunate performance side-effects there is no reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple-DES encrypted traffic. That way your traffic looks  normal  and perhaps anyone desiring to listen in will not even bother, since they know nobody is going to really trust crypto that has classified internals for important stuff.  mjr.
