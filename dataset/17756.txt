From: timr@sco.COM (Tim Ruckle) Subject: Who are The ``Rich\'\'? (was Re: Professors Whining About Pay)    Candidate Clinton promised to tax the rich, and most folks thought that was a pretty nifty idea.  Then President Clinton said he wanted families who make more than $100,000 to bear 70% of the new tax burden, and many were quick to complain that their six-figure income does not make them one of the well-to-do.  it is particularly ironic (to me) that it is in those traditionally liberal enclaves of the Bay Area and academia where the wealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of  just regular working-class folk .  Nobody will ever admit to being rich; everybody is middle class.  So who are The Rich?  Well, i shall throw out some stats from the 1990 Census and let you be the judge...

As a 12-year veteran of Silicon Valley, i have seen precious few } employment ads that call for PhDs.  And $65K is hardly chump change; } it is well above the median *household* income for the state.  Bay Area average household income is in the mid-$40,000 range.  National average is $31,889.  The Bay Area has nearly twice the national average of six-figure income households (9.1% vs 4.8%*).  The cost-of-living here may be high, but I do not think it is twice the national average...  } >In Los Angeles, modest home prices can be $500,000.    A 1,500-square-foot tract house in a Bay Area working-class neighborhood goes for about $250,000.  I doubt that the Los Angeles market is all that different.  It would appear that this definition of  modest  is perhaps a bit immoderate...  } So what?  they are no cheaper for those who are gainfully employed. }  } >In California, $65,000 is not upper-middle-class. }  } It depends upon your definition; it is clearly above average.  It is more than what two-thirds of California households make.  Seems to me that belonging to the upper one-third is not an unreasonable definition of  upper-middle-class .  Note that if that professor is spouse earns $35,000 they become one of Clinton is  rich  families.  Here is a breakdown of national, California, and Bay Area household incomes:     <$30K  $30-50K   $50-100K  $100K+ ------------------------------------ US  49%     24%        23%      4% * the Census Bureau did some weird CA  41%     26%        26%      7%   rounding here...more like 5% BA  34%     25%        31%      9%  And to add a little prespective:  A minimum wage earner working 40 hours/week makes $8,840/year.  The poverty line for a family of four is $15,171.  If they make up to twice that, the government considers them to be  working poor .  Say we decide to call this the  lower-middle-class .  Then how \'bout:  $30-50K annual income is  middle-class .  $50-100K is  upper-middle-class . $100K+ is  rich .  $1,000K+ is  filthy-rich .  and $10,000+ is  Bill Gates .  make sense? ;^)  -timr  -- there is nothing surer, The rich get rich and the poor get poorer, In the meantime, in between time, am not we got fun.                                                           --Raymond Egan
