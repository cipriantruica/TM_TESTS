From: myless@vaxc.cc.monash.edu.au (Myles Strous) Subject: J.C.Jensen is bitmap code  Greetings all. \tAccording to a FAQ I read, on 30 July 1992, Joshua C. Jensen posted an  article on bitmap manipulation (specifically, scaling and perspective) to the  newsgroup rec.games.programmer. (article 7716) \tThe article included source code in Turbo Pascal with inline assembly  language.  \tI have been unable to find an archive for this newsgroup, or a current  email address for Joshua C. Jensen. \tIf anyone has the above details, or a copy of the code, could they  please let me know.\tMany thanks. \t\t\t\t\tYours gratefully, etc.  Myles.  --  Myles Strous\t|\tEmail: myles.strous@lib.monash.edu.au raytracing fan\t|\tPhone: +61.51.226536  Got the same urgent grasp of reality as a cardboard cut-out.
