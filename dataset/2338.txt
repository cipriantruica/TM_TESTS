Alavi    [ssa@unity.ncsu.edu]  (919)467-7909 (H)  ======== \t \tFirst of all, without wanting to sound nagging and bossy, yes it is a trivial answer and that is perfectly fine ( otherwise how is one supposed to move up to the complicated and challenging questions, we net readers so much enjoy :) ?), and the massive crossposting of your article was not  justified... Please refer to appropriate newsgroups next time (by the way c.o.msw.misc is OK :) ). Now as far as your problem is concerned: try playing around with the settings in the \'Fonts...  dialog box under the window control menu (that little square at the top left corner of the window..).    --  Costas Malamas ____________________________________________________________ Georgia Institute of Technology  OIT UA -- Opinions expressed are not necessarily OIT is...
