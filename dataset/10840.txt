Right now they are billing it as voluntary, i.e. bend over, here it comes.  As soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out there, how much easier do you think it will be to redefine  on your own  to mean write it yourself and do not even THINK about distributing it...?  Get honest, no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW it is compromised already, and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed.  The NSA knows that making this stuff available to the public means handing it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process. Since when has export control stopped anyone (especially software wise)  Ask yourself carefully if   high quality secure NSA classified technology   is something they are going to hand out.  Not unless you can drive a NSA van through the holes.  uni (Dark)  --  uni@acs.bu.edu  ->  Public Keys by finger and/or request Public Key Archives at  DF610670F2467B99  97DE2B5C3749148C  Sovereignty is the sign of a brutal past.
