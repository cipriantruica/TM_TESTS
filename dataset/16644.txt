From: bf3833@pyuxe.cc.bellcore.com (feigenbaum,benjamin) Subject: Clinton is views on Jerusalem  I recently read that during Bill Clinton is campaign, he stated that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as Israel is capital.  According to the article, Mr. Clinton reaffirmed this after winning the presidency.  However, during recent talks with President Mubarak, Secretary of State Christopher stated that  the status of Jerusalem will be a final matter of discussion between the parties .  Now I do not want to start a big discussion over the status of Jerusalem.  All I want to know is if anyone can  authenticate Mr. Clinton is statements with dates, places, etc.  Thank you.  Ben.
