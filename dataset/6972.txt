Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars. Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they are  MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s.   Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights, look at a \'92 or \'93 model (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you shall see red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the car is hindquarters.  Those are not just white reflectors.   Harv
