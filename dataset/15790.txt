From: holland@CS.ColoState.EDU (douglas craig holland) Subject: Cop kills teenager  \tOK, here is something for all of those people who think cops are always more responsible then the rest of the population.  I found this article in the Rocky Mountain Collegian, Colorado State University is newspaper.  \tSUSPENDED POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED IN REVENGE TRIPLE HOMICIDE  PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth worked, said  you are going to die  and fatally shot him and two others, police said.  A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.  The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory condition Wednesday.  Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta, 23, of Cranston, was arrested at gunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson is Auto Enterprises in Foster, a rural town of about 4,000 people in northwest Rhode Island.  \tWell, this just goes to show that cops are capable of snapping, just like everyone else.  Now who was it who said only cops should have guns?  \t\t\t\t\t\tDoug Holland
