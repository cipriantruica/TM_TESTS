Absolutely nothing.  i am a VERY straight(as an arrow), 17-year old male that is involved in the BSA.  I do not care what gay people do among each other, as long as they do not make passes at me or anything.  At my summer camp where I work, my boss is gay. Not in a \'pansy\' way of gay (I know a few), but just \'one of the guys\'. He does not push anything on me, and we give him the same respect back, due to his position.  If anything, the BSA has taught me, I do not know, tolerance or something. Before I met this guy, I thought all gays were \'faries\'.  So, the BSA HAS taught me to be an antibigot.  Basically, It comes down to this: What you do among yourself is your own business. No one else has the right to tell you otherwise, unless it violates someone else is civil rights.
