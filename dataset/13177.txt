Just do not force it on others. If you have food that you want to  enhance with msg just put the MSG on the table like salt.  It is then the option of the eater to use it.  If you make a commerical product, just leave it out. You can include a packet (like some salt packets) if you desire.  Salt, pepper, mustard, ketchup, pickles ..... are table options. Treat MSG the same way.  I would not shove my condiments down your throat, do not shove yours down mine.  WFL  --  Walter Lundby
