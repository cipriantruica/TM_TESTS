The announcement talked about strong cryptography I believe.  Specifically:  \tnor is the U.S. saying that  every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.   Every vendor claims his product is unbreakable -- so this was sloppy wording.  I am not claiming that we private citizens should have access to the NSA is best, secret algorithms.  I do not want any NSA algorithms, actually.  i shall let them break my pitiful amateur algorithms -- and RSA is.  All I want is what I have already -- the ability and right to invent and use my own algorithms, share them with my friends and sell them.  --   - >  - Carl Ellison                                        cme@sw.stratus.com  - Stratus Computer Inc.
