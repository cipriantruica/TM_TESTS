For your purpose put following into your .login (if you are using csh or tcsh), for sh you have to modify it.  if (  $term  ==  xterm  ) then \techo  ^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}^G^[]1;${HOST}^G  endif  Note, ^[ stands for , in vi you can enter it by pressing Ctrl-V and the . Same for ^G, it means Ctrl-G. In vi: press Ctrl-V and then Ctrl-G. The first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second in the icon.  BTW, you can also put the current working directory in the title bar if you make an alias for cd:  alias cd \'cd  !* ; echo  ^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}: ${cwd}^G \'  greetings, Thomas --  Thomas Wolfram, thomas@aeon.in-berlin.de EANTC, TU Berlin, wolf@prz.tu-berlin.de, +49 030 31421294
