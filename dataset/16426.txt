We should all remember that if Nixon \thad not tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of his \tsubordinates in the Watergate burglary, the scandal would \tnever have brought down his presidency.  So far, Klinton seems \tto be stonewalling this the same way Tricky Dick did.  His whole \tcase seems to be  we did not do anything wrong .  However, if \tin the course of the investigation it turns out that the \tgov\'t DID do something wrong, and he tried to cover it up, \tthen that is an impeachable crime, I believe...    \tPerhaps he is inadvertently cooking up his own scandal...  Can you  \tsay  Wacogate , little neighbor?...   ;-)      *************************************************************************  *   Ya know, this being part of the  loyal opposition  is kinda fun for   *  *   a change.
