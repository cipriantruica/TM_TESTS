Yeah, and it is also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I do not argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal > image compression.  Uh huh.  i shall believe it when I see it.  i have been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still do not believe in it.  If it is so great, how come we do not see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it cannot, i shall wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I do not think it is a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  i shall reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  that is why I do not think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but I do not see anyone using it in a real product.  it is been six years since Iterated Systems was formed, right?  \t There are always going to be questions until there is a product \tout there,  Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first \tencoding devices in the summer, he says.  In March, Iterated \tSystems will have the other half of the system: the decoders.  \t\t- Scientific American, March 1990, page 77  Allen B (do not even get me started :-) )
