From: wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (Bill Mayhew) Subject: Re: mysterious TV problem -- source?  If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt supply.  Several sets i have looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits shut down the EHT supply section.  Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set operates nromally, then you know you have got a shorted regulator.  There are myriad other areas for problems, but i have seen the one above several times.  Also, if the set uses one, the trippler module may be shot; that is fairly common.   --  Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED
