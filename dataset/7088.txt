The MR2 is engine is noisy at the best of times,  >but not even a nice nose - it is one of those very ugly noises.   assuming yours is a non turbo MR2, the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline 4 that does not have balance shafts.  i guess toyota did not care about  little  details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling.  myself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration (or recommendation) which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no balance shafts..  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine.    if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a V6.   eliot
