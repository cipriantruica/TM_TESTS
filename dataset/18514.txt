Nut or not, he was clearly a liar.  He said he would surrender after   local radio stations broadcast his message, but he did not.  Then he   said he would surrender after Passover, but he did not.    None of which excuses the gross incompetence and disregard for the   safety of the children displayed by the feds.   As someone else   pointed out, if it had been Chelsea Clinton in there you would    probably have seen more restraint.   ---peter
