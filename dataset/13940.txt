SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software Engineering Institute).  i am not sure, but I believe that this rating only applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was *not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather through a \'brute force and ignorance\' attack on the problem during the Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and did the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a \'Warning\' status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if anything) from such a rating -- i shall have to get the latest copy of the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).  Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with control of the software process; the assumption is that a well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.  Most software in this country is produced by \'engineering practicies\' that only rate an SEI Level 1 (if that).   --   Insisting on perfect safety is for people who do not have the balls to live  in the real world.    -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I do not speak for others and they do not speak for me.
