Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client-server communications mechanism you are using.  Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps? These are maintained by the server, so copying them into a window is much cheaper.  Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs, or running in XSynchonize mode. --      -paul\tpmartz@dsd.es.com \t\tEvans & Sutherland
