Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for Kansas City, you shall find that Larry has been playing for the games, having played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the 4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.  >He then was sent down to >Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated >when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from >the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks >officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this is not quite accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing, which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which point he disclosed the injury. Since he did not disclose it, the Sharks and he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a no-no).  Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was hurt. I expect he shall surface with another team at some point (probably another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a bad judgement call.   >#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th >Acquired:\t\'91-92, free agent from Boston >Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)  > He >is very unlikely to be back next season.  Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but hustle is not always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto is neck and another wrapped around Otto is stick arm. Otto casually turned around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter was not there. Hustle can only cover size so far.  The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he has gone for good (ditto HUbie McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me  you have to make room for the kids . Carter, in fact, refused to report to K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto retirement, but I have not heard anything official. His only hope in hockey now is the Gulls.  >#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st >Acquired:\t\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft >Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)  >I do not understand why the Sharks did not let Quintin play any more than the >14 games he played this season.  Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I did not think he was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.  > He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you wish they would performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you can really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have trouble, since you do not see the off-puck action. your views from home and my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)  >#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st >Acquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft >Grade:\t\tI (?)  >After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the  Coffee.

You? Nah...   He was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate to judge the talent too quickly. Butn in Dody is case, I m tempted to make an exception.  But I will not.  --   Chuq  IMHO  Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com    Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ    Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)   San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)
