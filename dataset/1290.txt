David |>   I do not know about that...i have used Photoshop 2.5 on both a 486dx-50 and a Quadra 950...i had say they are roughly equal.  If anything the 486 was faster.  Both systems were running in 24 bit color and had the same amount of RAM (16 megs) I also believe the quadra had one of those photoshop accelerators.
