According to the legal practices of today is America, I imagine the legal definition of religion, if defined, may resemble the following:  \t Any system of belief or practice to which people are committed \tfor the benefit of society which must, in the opinion of secular \tthought, be isolated from political and educational influence.   \t Should any system of belief or practice to which people are \tcommitted be harmful or void of any benefit to society in the \topinion of religious thought as defined in the previous paragraph, \tisolation of such from political and educational influence would \tconstitute unreasonable censorship and an unlawful violation of \tcivil rights.   Someday, perhaps they will legalize benevolence :-)                  ^^^^^^^?
