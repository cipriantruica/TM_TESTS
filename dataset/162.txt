My policy with Bobby is posts, should anyone give a damn, is to flick through the thread at high speed, searching for posts of Bobby is which have generated a whole pile of followups, then go in and extract the hilarious quote inevitably present for .sig purposes. Works for me.  For the guy who said he has just arrived, and asked whether Bobby is for real, you betcha. Welcome to alt.atheism, and rest assured that it gets worse. I have a few pearls of wisdom from Bobby which I reproduce below. Is anyone (Keith?) keeping a big file of such stuff?        In Allah is infinite wisdom, the universe was created from nothing,         just by saying  Be , and it became. Therefore Allah exists.             --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah,          Wait. You just said that humans are rarely reasonable. does not that       contradict atheism, where everything is explained through logic and       reason? This is THE contradiction in atheism that proves it false.             --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah,                   Plus, to the believer, it would be contradictory                     to the Quran for Allah not to exist.             --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah,    and now      One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that say  Mom ,     because of the love of their mom. It makes for more virile men. Compare     that with how homos are raised.  Do a study and you will get my point.           -- Bobby Mozumder being Islamically Rigorous on alt.atheism  Mmmmm. Quality *and* quantity from the New Voice of Islam (pbuh).
