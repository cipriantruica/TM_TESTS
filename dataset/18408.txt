From: muttiah@thistle.ecn.purdue.edu (Ranjan S Muttiah) Subject: cults (who keeps them going ?)   Mr. Clinton said today that the horrible tragedy of the Waco fiasco should remind those who join cults of the dangers of doing so. Now, I began scratching my head thinking (a bad sign :-),  do not the  mainstream religions (in this case Christianity...or the 7th day  adventist in particular) just keep these guys going ? is not Mr. Clinton  condemning his own religion ? After all, is not it a cult too ?   ... bad thoughts these.
