I have a dozen, VERY blue LED is on my bench right now. They have a clear plastic case and when lit, are absolutely BLUE. The hue is sort of a  summer day cloudless sky blue  but make no mistake, they are blue.  You can buy them from Digikey, Circuit Specialist, Jameco (I think), LED-Tronics, Stanley Optoelectronics, and others. The current price is around $2.50 each for small quantities. I will also be selling them through my mail-order company in the near future (4 weeks). Write for details if interested.  John
