From: dmunroe@vcd.hp.com (Dave Gauge) Subject: Choice of gauges  If you had free reign to design your own instrument cluster, which gauges would you choose to have beyond the basic set?  I consider the basic set to be:  \t- tach  \t- coolant temp (or cylinder head temp for air-cooled engines) \t- oil pressure \t- amps  \t- speedo \t- fuel  others that are nice to have:  \t- volts (maybe this should be in the basic set) \t- vacuum/boost  I can think of a few others, but what are your ideas and why?  -Dave
