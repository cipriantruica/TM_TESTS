Phew! That takes a load off. I do not want to live forever.  I wish most Christians held this view.  You cannot walk across campus in spring without being assailed by fire-and-brimstone preachers.

Besides, why not rely on the positive aspects of your religion to win their faith?   -Tim    ______________________________________________________________________________ |\t\t\t\t|\t\t\t\t       \t       | |       Timothy J.
