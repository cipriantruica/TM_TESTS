They are not \tbeing used due to change of job, loss of interest etc.  \tRather than letting them gather dust, we would like to pass them \ton to others who may use them (of course at a price :-)  \tTopics Include: \t- C/C++/Other Programming Languages \t- UNIX/DOS/OS2/Windows/Other Operating System topics (General) \t- X/Motif/OLIT/Xwin \t- Networking and Digital Signal Processing \t- Computer Graphics \t- Microprocessors and Computer Architecture \t- Math \t- Software Engineering/Algorithms/Software Testing \t- Databases \t- Expert Systems  \tThe list is long and rather than posting it here I will email \tit by request.  I am going to keep the list updated and so will \trespond to all requests (lucky me :-)  \tIf you are interested drop me a line  \t======  S.
