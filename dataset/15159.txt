What?!?  \tThat last paragraph just about killed me.  The Deuterocanonicals have \tALWAYS been accepted as inspired scripture by the Catholic Church, \twhich has existed much longer than any Protestant Church out there. \tIt was Martin Luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to \tREMOVE certain books--not the fact that the Catholic Church decided \tto add some much later--that is the reason for the difference between \t Catholic  and  Protestant  bibles.    \tSorry for the tone--but that comment really irked me. \t\t\t\t\t- Mike Walker \t\t\t\t\t  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu \t\t\t\t\t  (Univ. of Illinois)
