Neither do Selanne is...   Are you comparing Cullen to Salami?  I would say that that is valid.  If Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami stand around the other team is blueline when the puck is in his own end?  >>The object of the game is not to feed Selanne - it is  >>to win.

Excuse me?  Are the Jets playing .500 hockey?  Let me check...yes - but just barely.  They have allowed more goals than they have scored.  Sounds an awful lot like Salami is +/- to me.  Sounds like they would be just as well off - or better - if he played the solid two-way game that our friends in Finland claim he is capable of.  But if he did that he would not be chal- lenging for the league lead in goals would he?  The Bi-Planes might be challenging for first however...  >you are worried about Teemu when you have Glenn Anderson on your team?  Now let us see...you have compared Timo to Anderson and Cullen.  who has next?  Mike Foligno?  >>We DON\'T KNOW what Selanne does best.  We do know what Jet is management >>wants.  And again, the object of the exercise is not to allow Selanne to >>do what he does best, it is to win hockey games.  >What he does best is score...so I refer you to my comment above.  Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he can play a solid two-way game.  I would have to say that this style of contribution would be more conducive to winning.  Or do not you  think so?  >>As it is now, Selanne >>is a grandstanding goal suck.  Did you see the way he parades around >>with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal?  You would think the >>Messiah had returned...  >Nope, did not see it.  I was too busy watching Foligno jump up and down after >_his_ goal....  I do not believe it!  You did compare him to Foligno!  (And I honestly had not read this far).  It would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking.  Your contributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you were not trying to be merely argumentative.  cordially, as always,  rm  --  Roger Maynard  maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca
