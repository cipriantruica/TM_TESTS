From: crh@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.dbp.de (Christian Huebner) Subject: Re: Manual Shift Bigots  In rec.autos you write:  >if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission, >it cannot be half bad..  :-)  This McLaren auto-transmission (I still think it is only half auto, but You may be right) has NOTHING to do with Your GM, Chrysler, Volvo, or whatever auto transmission. it is a normal manual transmission gearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do the shifting.   That means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if You take out  minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions  (Ferrari, Williams, McLaren(?),...) do not tell You, when to shift, either. However, these transmissions share an important disadvantage with Your stock auto-trannie: They are EXPENSIVE.  As long as these servo-shifted gearboxes are not available on  \'normal\' cars i am gonna stick with my manual. I just cannot see an advantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the loss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). But then I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway.  there is no point in making a religion out of this, I just wanted to point out a few technical facts and MY OWN opinion, so there is no need for a flame war.  >eliot  Have a safe ride  Chris
