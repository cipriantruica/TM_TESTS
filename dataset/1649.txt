From: deb47099@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Daniel E. Bradley) Subject: Fractal terrain generator?  \tDoes anyone know of a fractal terrain generator for Mac, something \tI could hopefully import into a 3D program like Swivel or Stratavision? \tI know Infini-D has built in capabilities, but I do not have access to \tInfini-D. I downloaded two programs from Umich, in graphics/fractals, \tbut both were from 1990-91 and crashed under System 7. I think they \twere Black and white anyway. Please, email me if you know of anything, \tas I do not check the newsgroups very often. \t\tThanks in advance. \t\t\tDan Bradley deb47099@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu
