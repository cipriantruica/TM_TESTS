I would appreciate any information, as I would like,  >once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.  \tI do not think the question is: \t\t will OS/2 X.X run Windows Y.Y apps now?   \tA more important question is: \t\t will subsequent OS/2 versions continue to run apps \t\tfrom subsequent Windows versions in the future?   \tCan it keep up?  Will a future OS/2 3.0 run Windows 4 apps? \tOLE2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come. \tAfter this fall, I believe IBM no longer has any rights to \tview Microsoft code.  After that, the only way to maintain \tsome sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer.  Would \tyou want to reverse-engineer an OLE2 application?   --  John A.
