From: wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (Bill Mayhew) Subject: Re: Adcom cheap products?  I have an Adcom GFA-555 that I got in 1985.  There certainly is not anything magic about it.  The components used are decent, but nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components.  The GFA-555 is a nice piece of equipment.  i am glad that Adcom had the guts to not over-do the packaging.  It irks me when I see audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they are supposed to serve.  I do not see any big deal about the geographic region in which something is assembled.  This is especially true for something as low-technology as a GFA-555.  i had hope that a GFA-545 would still work well after several years. Except under conditions of extreme abuse, there is not much there to go wrong.   --  Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED
