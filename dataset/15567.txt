I do not think we should draw borders around newsgroups, christians are free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups, and  muslims are free to so so in other groups as well.  it is up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning  postings. The problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups is the evangelistical method of telling that \'I am right, and you are wrong\'. This is true of both theists and atheists.  Hopefully a more constructive dialogue between the groups  would help concerning assumptions and colorization of views.  Cheers, Kent --- sandvik@newton.apple.com.
