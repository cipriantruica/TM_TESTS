From: mjcarley@unix2.tcd.ie (Michael Carley) Subject: DVI Viewers  I need some help in tracking down a dvi viewer for X. I have xdvi but we have not got the X libraries and includes installed- so  \t\ti) is there a way around this, as we are trying to avoid \t\t   installing the stuff (space is at a premium). \t\tii)would someone be prepared to make the binaries \t\t   available. We have a HP700 and a HP382.  \tThanks for any help \tMichael Carley, Dept. of Mech Engineering, \tTCD
