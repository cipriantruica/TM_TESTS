I, myself, think the F-86 is a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I would not even think of flying it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles on how they perform.  >We see  zero-defects operation  in many area|s of life.    Not to this degree.  >Calling shuttle flight characteristics *bizarre* in the same post  >as touting DC-X is interesting.    Why?  >DC-X will also have similar  zero-defects  issues (am I wrong?).    Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle is not reusable, it is salvagable).  >I am thinking of how DC-X will deploy a chute or reverse orientation at  >supersonic speeds.    The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.  >How much in DC-X is redundant?  that is the real question.  The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available thrust and still land safely.  >Everything we do in life has zero-defects issues at times (agree?).  Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that is not the same thing. Shuttle simply is not a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.  >As a doctor, I can not error in my diagnosis and treatment recommendations.    You do not put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You would not for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effects would you?  >While DC-X is R&D program makes good sense, I am less optimistic about DC-X  >as you (and apparently others) are.    You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do need to do to build SSTO.  >But, DC-X will still have failures.  It is the nature of aerospace R&D.    Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop. Shuttle does not. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle is not.  >it is successors are not slated to be passenger carrying.    Not true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will carry passengers.  >The impression I had >when I visited MacDac Huntington Beach is Open House was that the payload space >was limited and the man-ratable version was decades away.  I would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original schedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.  >Shuttle is the only method in the free world of orbiting large life sciences >and medical related packages.
