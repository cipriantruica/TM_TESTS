From: alerman@netcom.com (Alexander Lerman) Subject: HELP! How To Have a QUIET PC?  The fan in my power supply, like most, is distractingly LOUD. Has anyone found  a solution to running a pc with peace and quiet? Short of buying a notebook  PC, I do not know what to do. Oh yeah, I did hear about a power supply called a   Silencer  - which is supposed to be more quiet. Has anyone had experience with this? I was quoted a price of $225 (!) for a 270Watt Silencer.  i have even considered stuffing my PC case in one of those acoustic  printer  enclosures , but that would not be the most elegant solution. Also, i am  guessing that would also cut the ventilation.  Any other ideas?  Thanks in advance for ANY suggestions! Please E-mail whatever you post...  --  Alexander Lerman  (510) 848-4888 (voice)
