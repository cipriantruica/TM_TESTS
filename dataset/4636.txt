From: wjeuerle@athena.mit.edu (William J. Euerle) Subject: Re: Centris 610 flaky?  i have been playing with a centris 610 (8/230) for the last couple weeks.  The only problem that I have seen is that a couple of the applications I run are incompatible with the 040 is processor cache, so I have to run with it turned off. Actually, the main thing I do not like it is that it does not have a software powerup/powerdown, and the power switch is DIRECTLY UNDER THE FLOPPY DRIVE!  (I have not hit it thinking it would eject the disk, but some tired night i am going to be really upset with that design decision.....)  In all, no problems with it. floppy and printing have been just fine.  (printing is done across a localtalk net, not a directly connected printer)  Bill
