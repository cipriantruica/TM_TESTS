From: rab@well.sf.ca.us (Bob Bickford) Subject: Re: More technical details   Another objection occurred to me.  There was a comment about how supposedly there would only be one decode box, operated by the FBI. This is flat ridiculous, and I do not believe it for a millisecond. Even *if* they in fact only build one (or two or some other small number) of these, that will not stop others from building one.  Make it work like two Clipper-chip phones, one listening to each side of the recorded conversation.  i shall have to have another look at the specs posted so far, but offhand I did not see anything that would preclude this sort of thing..... --         Robert Bickford                       rab@well.sf.ca.us  Treasurer and Newsletter Editor,    /-------------------------------------   Lib.
