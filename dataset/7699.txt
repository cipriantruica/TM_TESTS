There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash. The confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap between the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify:  Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a \tliving. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody is standards, \tanyway) because they have never held education above basic \treading/writing/math skills to be that important to their \teventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant. \t(They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage \tof any group).  White trash:  White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the \tword \'nigger\' better than any black person I ever met, only \twith the added \'bonus\' that white trash are mean as hell.  \t-- my father. Genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under- \tqualified), good-for-nothing, dishonest, white people who are \tmean as snakes. The  squeal like a pig  boys in _Deliverance_ \tmay or may not have been rednecks, but they were sure as hell \twhite trash.  White trash are assuredly intolerant of anything outside of their group or level of understanding. Rednecks may or may not be. --  Curtis Jackson\t   cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com\t\'91 Hawk GT\t\'81 Maxim 650 DoD#0721 KotB  \'91 Black Lab mix  Studley Doright   \'92 Collie/Golden  George   There is no justification for taking away individuals\' freedom  in the guise of public safety.  -- Thomas Jefferson
