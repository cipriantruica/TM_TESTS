From: npm@netcom.com (Nancy P. Milligan) Subject: Re: Need advice with doctor-patient relationship problem  i had dump him.  Rude is rude and it seems he enjoys belittling and humiliating you.  But do not just dump him, write to him and tell him why you are firing him.  If you can, think about sending a copy of your letter to whoever is in charge of the clinic where he works,  if applicable, or maybe even to the AMA.  do not be vindictive in your letter, be truthful but VERY firm.  But do not be a victim and just put up with it.  Take control!  it shall make you feel great!  Nancy M. --  Nancy P.
