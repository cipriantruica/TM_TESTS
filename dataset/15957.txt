Does this bill allow or deny off-duty police from carrying concealed?  From what information that I have, Iowa has a discretionary permit policy on CCW.  If S 303 allows police(off-duty) to carry concealed then I would be inclined to oppose it.  I do not believe off-duty police officers should have any more rights than civilians.  If law or policy prevents law-abiding citizens from being armed for self defense then why should off-duty police officer be treated any differently.
