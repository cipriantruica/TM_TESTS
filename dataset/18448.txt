Well, looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various places at the same time, which would indicate that this was a planned action. i am sure FBI and BATF did not *deliberately* start a possible fire, having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier  method. Looking at the careful operation, and use of tear gas that as I know do not start fires, it is less likely that this  was the case.  Sorry, but my bets are on fanatical people keen to start Armageddon -- theirs.  Cheers, Kent --- sandvik@newton.apple.com. ALink: KSAND -- Private activities on the net.
