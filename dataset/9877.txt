From: gld@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Gary L Dare) Subject: Re: Rangers name Keenan coach  clarinews@clarinet.com (UPI) writes in clari.sports.hockey:  >\tNEW YORK (UPI) -- Mike Keenan, whose NHL coaching history >has been to wear out his welcome despite an impressive penchant for  >winning, has come to the city that embraces victors above all else.  Well, I could become a fan ... (-;  Seriously, this news coming since Thursday has effectively robbed the Islanders and the Devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost everywhere that i have sampled ... in fact, the playoffs almost do not exist now. )-; Ranger fans calling in to WFAN or to New York One is midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near- orgasm over Keenan is hiring.  (Summarizing: Keenan is a winner and will give the Broadway Bums  hada business\' in pursuing the next Cup chase ...)  >\tThe Chicago Blackhawks cut their last tie with Keenan when >he was forced out as general manager in November. He had given up >Chicago is coaching duties a year ago and his thirst for the power >of a GM now increases the pressure on beleaguered Rangers GM Neil >Smith.  This will be an interesting combination to watch ... Keenan has been paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach, but his advice on any player moves will be listened to closely.  A lot of big player moves will happen --- remember that Keenan got rid of Denis Savard.  The country club days are over ...  >\t``When Keenan left Chicago I could not help but think about  >him as our coach,\'\' Smith said. ``There was an indication he would  >be taken off the market. I feared that and could not let that happen.\'\'  If Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offered Keenan the big money to put-up-and-shut-up back in January, the Rangers might not be heading for golf now ...  >\tKeenan, 43, takes on a demoralized team that offers him a >chance to fashion yet another of his reclamation projects -- at the >highest salary ever commanded by an NHL coach.
