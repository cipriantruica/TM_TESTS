Psalm85(JPS): For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm. O LORD, You will favor Your land, restore Jacob is fortune; You will forgive Your people is iniquity, pardon all their sins; Selah; You will withdraw all Your anger, turn away from Your rage. Turn again, O God, our helper, revoke Your displeasure with us. Will you be angry with us forever, prolong Your wrath for all generations? Surely You will revive us again, so that Your people may rejoice in You. Show us, O LORD, Your faithfulness; grant us Your deliverance. Let me hear what God, the LORD, will speak; He will promise well-being to His people, His faithful ones; may they not turn to folly. His help is very near those who fear Him, to make His glory dwell in our land. Faithfulness and truth meet; justice and well-being kiss. Truth springs up from the earth; justice looks down from heaven. The LORD also bestows His bounty; our land yields its produce. Justice goes before Him as He sets out on His way.
