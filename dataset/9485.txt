So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM gets more runs?  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but  does not score them all himself, who cares?  Consider:  Player A: single. Player B: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd. Player C: Double, B to 3rd. Player D: Sac fly.  B gets a run, D gets an RBI.  Are you *sure* they helped the team more than A and C?  Think hard, now.  >Flame Away  As you wish.  Roger
