Krillean  against  Kirilian . Get it? ;-)  BTW, I think you are a bit of base yourself, since, to my knowledge, the electromagnetic field around a stone is rather abscent. But still, a stone has a nice  aura  on the Kirilian photographs.  do not remember excactly, but  corona discharge  I think is a more fitting expression than aura. Think you shall find something on this in the skeptic-faq.   Cheers, \tJostein
