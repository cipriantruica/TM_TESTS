From: mmccolli@comanche.ess.harris.com (Mike McCollister) Subject: Faster OAK VGA drivers???  i am using an OAK based VGA card on my computer (640x480x256).  i have downloaded the driver from ftp.cica.indiana.edu and i have had good luck with it.  However, does anyone know if a faster driver is available for this card?  Thanks,  Mike    _________________________________________________________________________  /                                                                        /| +------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | |  _________                          |                                  | | | |  _   _  | Michael J.
