From: med50003@nusunix1.nus.sg (WANSAICHEONG KHIN-LIN) Subject: Re: MORBUS MENIERE - is there a real remedy?  It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow \'beat the system\' and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure. Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the \'cure\' questionable when applied to all sufferers.  This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they did not trumpet their story all over the world?  As a parting note, was not there some studies done on Gingko seeds for Meniere is? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial of that? it is probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort. And you had be helping answer the question for future sufferers.)  gervais
