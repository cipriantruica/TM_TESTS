From: netops@tekgen.bv.tek.com (Randy King) Subject: left turn signal will not stop automaticaly  The subject says it all. My 1984 Chev S10 Pickup is left turn signal does not stop after turning. What cause this to stop automaticaly?. Is this a mechanical problem by the steering wheel?.  NOTE: This truck has an after market steering wheel (GT-Grant) installed.
