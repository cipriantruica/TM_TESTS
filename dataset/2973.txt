The only reason I did not do it in the first place was because I had several bootable 5-1/4 is and some 5-1/4 based install disks which expected the A drive.  I order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3-1/2 and the number of  stupid  install programs that cannot handle an alternate drive are declining with time - the ones I had are now upgraded.  And as for the bootable 5-1/4 is I just cut 3-1/2 replacements.  If switching the drives is not an option, you might be able to wire up a drive switch to your computer chasis.  I have not tried it but I think it would work as long as it is wired carefully.  Gordon Lang
