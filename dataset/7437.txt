Unless the law has been changed recently, carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal. I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a traffic infraction and observed a .357 magnum revolver sitting on the seat.  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon because it was not concealed.  The article stated that if the gun had been discovered in the glove box, it would have been considered a crime.  -- Ken Franklin \tThey say there is a heaven for people who wait AMA     \tAnd some say it is better but I say it am not GWRRA           i had rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints DoD         The sinners are lots more fun, Y\'know only the good die young
