Also consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that wants more government funding and work tossed their way.  Despicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably outweighs the drawbacks.  And there are a whole bunch of people who think the whole thing is just peachy keen. If it is only going to be used against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well it must be good. :p --  Truth is hard to find and harder to obscure.
