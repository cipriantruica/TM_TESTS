I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that David Koresh had  explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40 feet into the air.   It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the first place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs were not living in a fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why did not they do this?  Could it be that they did not have any explosives or similar munitions?  I just do not buy what the ATF and FBI have been saying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.  Here is something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I do not think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this so-called  explosion  resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited. We figure that this is what it was because of how the  explosion  looked and sounded.  Obviously, it was not due to something like TNT, dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.  is not it curious that the ATF was not very forthcoming about how the four officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown by the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN\'T READY TO RELEASE THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide? Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.  What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the compound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade body during one of the lawyer is visits to the compound.  Later on the lawyer gave the grenade body (I do not know if it was a dud or a spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  would not it be a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets, or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers will not investigate until the ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to make sure that others  find  what they want for them to  find  if you know what I mean.  i am probably being a little paranoid here but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades. Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.
