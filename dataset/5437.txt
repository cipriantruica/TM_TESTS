From: axel@hpcvlx (Axel Deininger) Subject: X Meta File, Anyone?  Hi,  i am working on a project that involves storing an application is rendering to an X display and then playing it back again.  Rather than   reinvent the wheel , it like to find: \t* a file format for saving X protocol. \t* software that saves and replays such a session.  Any ideas out there?  i have heard that there is a version of Xscope that will save and replay sessions.  i had be willing to share much of the code I develop back to the X community.
