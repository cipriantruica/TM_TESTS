Simply think up a question to ask her about her involvement, but be very careful to phrase it in such a way that there can be no Jesuitical evasion or a true but wholly misleading answer.  In this country, MI5 are *experts* at answering these questions; for instance there was a British journalist (Jonathon Moyle) killed in South America a couple of years ago.  Parliament asked  Was he an MI5 employee   No.  - turns out afterwards he was not paid, therefore was not an employee.
