Well, the cable co. decided to totally pre-empt the game (no tape delay, no nothing) for a stupid telethon!  Hockey is very big around here, too.  I had to listen to  my  Penguins win on my car radio out in the parking lot.  I can just be thankful for a strong radio because being 230 miles from Pittsburgh, the reception usually is not good at all.  I cannot believe I picked it up during the middle of the day.  George
