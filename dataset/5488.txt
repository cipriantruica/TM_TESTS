From: morgaine@siap.sublink.org (Nadia Pitacco (Morgaine)) Subject: Dump of login screen     i am running HP-UX 8.07 with HP VUE 2.01 and I need a hardcopy of   the login window (the one asking  for login and password) to    include in a manual.    I have tried:    xwd -display hostname:0 -root -out login.xwd     from a login on a remote terminal, but it does not work.    Xwd seems to wait for the window server, but the window   server does not answer.     Any suggestions? I must use xwd because I do not have access to   ftp and I cannot obtain another program to grab the screen.    Thanks in advance                                            Nadia Pitacco  --  \t------------------------------------------------------- \t-  Nadia Pitacco                 SIAP Sistemi S.p.A.  - \t-  via G.B.
