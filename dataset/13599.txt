Subject: Space FAQ 02/15 - Network Resources From: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)  Archive-name: space/net Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $  NETWORK RESOURCES  OVERVIEW      You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of     computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In     general, however, systems connected to \'the net\' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special  iservers\'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet \'netnews\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     \'group name\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called  isci.space.news\',  isci.space\',  isci.space.shuttle\',  isci.astro\',     and \'talk.politics.space\'. Contributors \'post\' submissions (called     \'articles\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body     should be in the format  isubscribe space John Public\') to join. Note     that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of     a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are     available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve \tjulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README     for further details.      Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle     Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line     elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources     as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.      GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning     System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to     gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.      Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in     space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.      Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;     discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid     capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to     space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and     selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from     gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,     or by email to space-tech-request if you do not have FTP access.      SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and     Development of Space and other interested parties. Email     LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying  SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your     name . Email saying  INDEX SEDS-L  to list the archive contents.      SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status     reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in     Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email     LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying  SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name  to join.     Email saying  INDEX SEDSNEWS  to list the archive contents.      Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which     carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him     to join the list.      As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a     mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate     \'please remove me from this list\' messages which are sent to the list     address rather than the request address.  PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION      In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is     posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group     sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the     individuals posting this information are performing a service for all     net readers, and do not take up their time with frivolous requests.
