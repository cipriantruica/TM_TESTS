Based on some exp. I must say that the connections between the power supply and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the last phase (lower Voltage).  So you can do following if you are used to such technical terms. 1) Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray 2) readjust the 5 Volt level of your powersupply 3) use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowin\xef\xbf\xbd through the floppy!    (a fixed piece of paper can prevent this) if you do not know how to do it beg a friendly technician!  Christian Bauer  bauer@informatik.uni-ulm.de
