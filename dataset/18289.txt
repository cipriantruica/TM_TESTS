From: buddha@iastate.edu (Scott H Vann) Subject: The bad press Islam has recieved.   \tI recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic   person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media.   When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played   up as an Islamic Terrorist.  However, when the a Serbian terrorist attacks   the Croations, its not a Christian terrorist, its just a terrorist. \tI have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe   the press, that Islam is somehow tied to violence.  Often times you hear   things like  They just do not value human life like we do...  and so on.   I was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can   change this image, or how I can help my friends to see that this is just    hype.  I would appreciate any serious suggestions or comments via e-mail,   and i am not interested in hearing about how right the press is.  \t\t\t\t\t-Scott Vann \t\t\t\t\tbuddha@iastate.edu
