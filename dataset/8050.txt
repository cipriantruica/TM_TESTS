Message-ID:  Date: 15 Jul 92 09:47:10 GMT References:  Lines: 84   These are the figures from the Performance Bikes lock test, taken without permission of course. The price is for comparison. All the cable locks have some sort of armour, the chain locks are padlock and chain. Each lock was tested for a maximum of ten minutes (600 secs) for each test:  \tBJ\tBottle jack \tCD\tCutting disc \tBC\tBolt croppers \tGAS\tGas flame  The table should really be split into immoblisers (for-a-while) and lock-to-somethings (for-a-short-while) to make comparisons.  \t\tType\tWeight\tBJ\tCD\tBC\tGAS\tTotal\tPrice \t\t\t(kg)\t(sec)\t(sec)\t(sec)\t(sec)\t(sec)\t(Pounds) ======================================================================== ========= 3-arm\t\tFolding\t.8\t53\t5\t13\t18\t89\t26 Cyclelok\tbar  Abus Steel-o-\tCable\t1.4\t103\t4\t20\t26\t153\t54 flex  Oxford\t\tCable\t2.0\t360\t4\t32\t82\t478\t38 Revolver  Abus Diskus\tChain\t2.8\t600\t7\t40\t26\t675\t77  6-arm\t\tFolding\t1.8\t44\t10\t600\t22\t676\t51 Cyclelok\tbar  Abus Extra\tU-lock\t1.2\t600\t10\t120\t52\t782\t44  Cobra\t\tCable\t6.0(!)\t382\t10\t600\t22\t1014\t150 (6ft)  Abus closed\tChain\t4.0\t600\t11\t600\t33\t1244\t100 shackle\t  Kryptonite\tU-lock\t2.5\t600\t22\t600\t27\t1249\t100 K10  Oxford\t\tU-lock\t2.0\t600\t7\t600\t49\t1256\t38 Magnum  Disclock\tDisc\t.7\tn/a\t44\tn/a\t38\t1282\t43 \t\tlock  Abus 58HB\tU-lock\t2.5\t600\t26\t600\t64\t1290\t100  Mini Block\tDisc\t.65\tn/a\t51\tn/a\t84\t1335\t50 \t\tlock ======================================================================== =========  Pretty depressing reading. I think a good lock and some common sense about where and when you park your bike is the only answer. i have spent all my spare time over the last two weeks landscaping (trashing) the garden of my (and two friends with bikes) new house to accommodate our three bikes in relative security (never underestimate how much room a bike requires to manouver in a walled area :( ). Anyway, since the weekend there are only two bikes :( and no, he did not use his Abus closed shackle lock, it was too much hassle to take with him when visiting his parents. A minimum wait of 8 weeks (if they do not decide to investigate) for the insurance company to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin.  Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US but very common in the UK. The UK distributor, given in the above article is: \tMichael Brandon Ltd, \t15/17 Oliver Crescent, \tHawick, \tRoxburgh TD9 9BJ. \tTel. 0450 73333  The UK distributors for the other locks can also given if required.  do not lose it \tIan  --  _______________________________________________________________________   Ian Harvey, University College Swansea         Too old to rock\'n\'roll   eeharvey@uk.ac.swan.pyr                              Too young to die                               \'79 GS750E
