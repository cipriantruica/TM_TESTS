Infrared astronomy   did not really get started until something like 25 yrs. ago; it  did not explode until IRAS in 1983.  Gamma-ray (and I think   X-ray) observations did not really get started until the \'70s.  I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in   general, and I know that extreme UV (short of 1000 Angstroms)  observations, until the EUVE (launched last year) had almost   no history except a few observations on Skylab in the \'70s.   Twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only   had access to optical or radio instruments.  Now, with far more  instruments available, growth in some of these new fields has  resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of   total astronomical work.   >Seriously, though, you are never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit >as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics >and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit >anyway.  fc> That would be true, if adaptive optics worked well in the visable. fc> But take a look at the papers on the subject: They refer to anything fc> up to 100 microns as  visable .

Hmm, some of the folks in this department planning on using   adaptive optics at the 5 m at Palomar for near-infrared   observations (1 and 2 microns) might be surprised to hear this.   And is not the NTT already pushing toward 0.1 arcsecond resolution,   from a ground-based site (remember 0.1 arcseconds was one of the   selling points of HST).      --                          | e-mail: lazio@astrosun.tn.cornell.edu    T.
