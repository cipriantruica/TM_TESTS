I have a new doctor who gave me a prescription today for something called     Septra DS.  He said it may cause GI problems and I have a sensitive stomach     to begin with.  Anybody ever taken this antibiotic.  Any good?  Suggestions     for avoiding an upset stomach?  Other tips?  i have taken Septra.  My daughter has taken it many times for ear infections.  It works sometimes.  It is a sulfa drug.  About the only problem I found was that i am sensitive and developed a rash after nine days of a ten day course.  No more Septra for me.  My doctor was remiss in not telling me to watch out for a rash.  I was quite in the dark and did not realize that it could be a drug reaction.  No harm done though.  Doug   -- Douglas S.
