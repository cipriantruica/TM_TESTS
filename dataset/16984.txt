Actually, Civil Libertarians believe in the fundamental freedoms that belong to human beings. They would support the Jews against the Nazis or anyone else who tries to oppress them and they would support the Arabs against the Israelis and any other such oppressive regimes (Iraq etc.)    >   BTW, I could not care less for what Andi Beyer appreciates.
