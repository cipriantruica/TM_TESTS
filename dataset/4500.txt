First of all, I would not advise wasting your time with Apple.  they will treat you like an idiot and you will not get any answers (a personal opinion).  The safest thing to do is match the SVGA monitor is scanning rates with Apple is rates.  I do not know Apple is video scanning rates, but I use the Micron Xceed 30 is rates, as they are a good approximation.  About cables: you just have to go out to someplace like Fry is and get a few Mac-VGA cables and try them out.  I have a ViewSonic 5E (14 ) and I use an NEC adaptor.  Other monitors may use other adaptors.  I also have a Mac->832x624 adaptor that tricks System into thinking the monitor is an Apple 16 .  I need to readjust the vertical and horizontal sizes but it works fairly well.  \t Just like everything else in life, the right lane ends in half a mile.
