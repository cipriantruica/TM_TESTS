I looked back at this, and asked some questions of various people and got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed. The US has not sold Iraq any arms.  Their navy is entirely made of F-USSR vessels.  Their airforce (not including stuff captured from Kuwait which I am not as sure about), does not include any US equipment.  Their missiles are all non-US.  Their tanks are almost all soviet, with about 100 French tanks (older ones). The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal is a few M113s.  Those were not sold to Iraq.  Iraq captured them from other countries (like Kuwait).  Information is hard to prove.  You are claiming that the US sold information?  Prove it.   Now, how did the US build up Iraq again?  I just gave some fairly conclusive evidence that the US did not sell arms to Iraq.  Information is hard to prove, almost certainly if the US did sell information, then that fact is classified, and you cannot prove it.  If you can provide some useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq, I am very interested, but not if you just make claims based on what  everyone knows .  --  *************************************************************************** * mccullou@whipple.cs.wisc.edu * Never program and drink beer at the same * * M^2                          *  time.
