From: yvon@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Yvon Lavoie) Subject: Hot, Cold Streaks ???   Ok guys, I need a list of the teams who have been hot or cold during the last 25 games.  does not need to be accurate, a rough guess will do.  i am about to enter a playoff pool and I want to know who is hot going into the playoffs.  do not need to mention Pittsburgh.  They cannot get any hotter than they are now.   P.S. I need this by Sunday  Yvon Lavoie
