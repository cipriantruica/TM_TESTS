He will kill it if it becomes a threat.  For example, let us say the scientist creates a Tyrannosaurus Rex and it breaks free of its confines and starts devouring the population.  The scientist would not hesitate in killing it.  God creates us to be His loving companions.  He knows whether we are true in  our love for Him or not.  And He lets us know the consequences of rejecting Him. God cannot abide by sin.  By rejecting God, a person becomes an enemy of God, one that must be killed by Him.  Note:  I say that God and God alone is worthy to be Judge, Jury and Executioner.  We are not called to carry out such duties because we are not worthy.   |> Who is god to impose its rules on us ?
