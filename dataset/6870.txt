From: CPKJP@vm.cc.latech.edu (Kevin Parker) Subject: Insurance Rates on Performance Cars SUMMARY       I recently posted an article asking what kind of rates single, male drivers under 25 yrs old were paying on performance cars. Here is a summary of the replies I received.         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   i am not under 25 anymore (but is 27 close enough).   1992 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (300hp model). No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1, airbag, abs, security alarm, single.   $1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.   After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.   I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.   Hope this helps.   Steve Flynn University of Delaware ======================================================================== 45       Kevin:       (Hope I remembered your name correctly)...       You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year     I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the     same inquiry as you.       Age: 24 (then and now)     Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD     Driving Record: Clean     State: Illinois     Cost: $820/6 mos.       I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos.     Also, i am single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.       i have got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more     than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe i am just lucky.       Hope the info helps.

My rates from State Farm (with a passive restraint deduction) on liability, $500 deductible comprehensive, and $500 deductible collision are roughly $1300/year. (I was paying just over $1100/year for a \'92 Escort LX.)   \t\t\t\tJames   James P.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent is office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.    If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the \'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.    If you buy the Porsche 924, we will have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it is another story again - we will cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.     But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\'t make sense.     that is what the book says.  We do not insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.    I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ / | | |)[~|)/~   |   Everyone is entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ || |    _| /|_|/|)[_|  _|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

(knock on wood...) Mass,   \tOne thing that makes a HUGE difference in MASS is the town you live in. i am personally in one of the best towns within reasonable distance of Boston.  If I moved to the absolute best it would go down to about $1150, if I moved to the worst it would be $2000+..   \tAlso one accident and a couple of tickets, would probably add another $600...     \t_RV     ======================================================================== 43 I have a 1990 Mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd, am 23 years old and have no tickets that went on my record.  I live in Illinois just outside of Chicago and pay $1560 a year with full coverage at State Farm.  I did get a small discount because of my alarm system($30 a year).  I only live 15 miles from Chicago but if I actually lived in the city the price would be about $2000 a year. ======================================================================== 41 i am over 25, but in case you are interested anyway, i am insuring a 93 SHO for $287/6 month.  Thats 100k personal+300k total+100k property with 250 deductible, glass and towing, State Farm.   ======================================================================== 39   Unless you are under 20 or have been driving for less than 5 years, I think you are being seriously ripped off.  I do not have one of the performance cars you listed, but if your record is clean, then you should not be paying over $2K.   Did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find? Although rates are supposed to be standardized, i have found that most places I initially call, give me some ridiculously high quote and *finaly*, I hit one that is much lower.   Also, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at renewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a low rate.  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance companies 8^).   Good luck, Serge
