He might hit .300. he shall never hit 20+ homers. I think you went 2 for 4 on this one.   >bases... and they start guys like Nixon and Bream ahead >of him!   I cannot really see that advantage of Nixon >over Deon except that Nixon is a better defensive outfielder.   \t\t       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \tYou said it all right there.   \tDoes anyone else out there not like Deon? I think he has all hype. His .300 season last year was good, but i am not convinced that he can do it again. It reminds me (sorry) of the year 1987(?) when Tim Wallach hit 30 or so homers and had 127 RBI. It never even came close to happening  again. Of course, maybe I just prefer guys who go about their business and do not play it up for the attention. Just my HO.  Doug Roberts - Larry Walker is God. Delino Deshields thinks he is.   \t       (John Bratt, if you are out there, send me some email. \t\tMy system cannot find your site!)
