And you had be wrong about that too.  Note that Texas is not unique in this  more with-gun deaths than with-car deaths , but some of the other states where it happens have extremely strict gun laws.  Oops - so much for the  meaning .  It is not clear that the comparision means anything anyway as car accidents are unintentional while gun deaths are not, but if we are going to make it, let us at least be honest.  >*I* should not suffer because of others.... >We all agree on this one, BUT we also live in a sociaty and therefor >we will have to give up *SOME* of our \'freedom\' (Note the \'\').  Give it up for what?  Gun control does not have any benefits, so it fails by this standard.  >Do you have an insurance?? >Then you shall have to pay because of what others do...  Note that insurance gives me something in return - gun control does not.  >-What the hell is he trying to say ?? >When you live in a society (USA are stilll counted as one...) you >have to saccrifice. >The question is HOW MUCH.  that is half the question - the rest is  and what do you get for your sacrifice .  If the answer to the second question is  nothing , as it is for gun control, then we do not have to ask the first question because getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified.  -andy --
