From: tominatr@ac.dal.ca Subject: SCSI and IDE: what is the difference?  Stupid question from a new IBM PC user:  i am going to be selling my Mac and getting a Gateway 2000.  What is the difference between IDE HD and SCSI HD?  The GW 486DX-33V comes with a 250MB Western Digital IDE drive. I asked how much more for the Seagate 500MB SCSI drive.  The guy asked me  Why are you going with SCSI? .  I was lost for an answer. I just said  I know Seagate better as a company, from a satisfaction point of view .  Are SCSI drives faster than IDE?  i am not buying my GW for another 4 months or so, but this is a question that has bugged me for a while.        - Tom N.
