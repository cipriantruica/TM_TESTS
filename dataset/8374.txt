If you had been looking in your mirror, you would have seen the guy coming  before you heard the screeching tires.  When you are stopped at a light:  1)  Stop so that you are got space in front of you, and a quick easy escape route (between lanes, into a crosswalk, up a driveway, somewhere) if someone decides they want to plow into you.  2)  Keep the bike in first with the clutch in until at least a couple of cars are stopped behind you, so you do not have to waste a second you do not have trying to get it in gear if you need to move.  3)  Watch your mirrors.  In that situation, most of the hazards you are  trying to avoid are coming from behind you.  SIPDE (<-- msf-geek-speak) is not just for when you are moving.  And you are less likely to panic and stall the bike if you have got time to prepare before the guy is tires lock up behind you.  (You still get the bejeezus scared out of you, but it is more a feeling of quickly-rising dread than a sudden jolt.)      --  Ray Shea    \t\t  UniSQL, Inc.\t\t \t unisql!ray@cs.utexas.edu  DoD   : Team Twinkie : \'88 Hawk GT
