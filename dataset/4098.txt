From: simsh@aix02.ecs.rpi.edu (Hillel Y. Sims) Subject: How often are SIMMs bad (mail order)?  Hi everyone. Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from Mac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed, and we found that it did not work properly. When you put the computer in  thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering and fuzzy. So I called them up and i am going to return it for a new one.  My question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general? Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? Is this a rarity? This is the first chip i have ordered so I have no other experience in this area. i am just curious if anyone else has had the same type of experience.  that is about it. Please email me, and if people want, I can post a summary. Thanks all. --  Hillel Sims  -----  simsh@rpi.edu  -----  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute   Is rot13 rotated 13 forward or backward?  \t--Anonymous
