If i am Joe Torre, i am \tgoing to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  he has \tgot Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter -  \tcoming up - there is no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign  \tin that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.   \tit is his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin  \twas there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.   \tBTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third  \tand going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the  \treplay, there is Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a  \tserious problem.  The Card is were not good base runners at all last year  \tand I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.  > >I cannot take this anymore > \tWell, i am still hanging in there.  \tGO REDBIRDS!!
