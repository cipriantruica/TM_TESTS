From: sharma@tiger.vill.edu (Sanjeev Sharma) Subject: Positioning a window, under openlook.  Hi there netters,  I require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (0,0) (top left corner) of my screen (root window). Could some windows guru out there help me on how to go about doing this. I write the whole program which creates the window with the image it displays - I require the image to appear at the top-left corner so that I can grab it for recording on to video, using a MIniVas controller, which expects the window at the same spot every time.  Thanks in advance.  sincerely,  Sanjeev Sharma  --  _____________________________________________________________________ Office:\t\t\t\t\t     e_mail:\t    Deptt. of Computing Science\t\t     \tsharma@monet.vill.edu    Villanova University\t\t\t     (215)645-6463
