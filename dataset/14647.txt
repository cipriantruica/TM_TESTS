From: atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Cardinal Ximenez) Subject: Re: Opinions asked about rejection     Here is how I talk to non-Christians who are complaining about Hell.  ME:\t Do you believe you are going to Heaven?  HIM:\t I do not believe in Heaven.  ME:\t So are you going there?  HIM:\t If there was a heaven, I would.  ME:\t But since there is not a Heaven, you are not going there, are you?  HIM:\t No.     The point is that Heaven is based on faith--if you do not believe in heaven, there is no way you are going to be in it.   Of course, the next step is,  I do not believe in Hell either, so why will I be there?   It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God. Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never see God--so they do, in fact, believe that they are going to Hell.   Hell does not have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because it is eternal,  and it is a lot worse than Heaven.  that is the only comparison that matters.
