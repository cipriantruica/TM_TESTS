ALink: KSAND -- Private activities on the net.  A lot of people will not agree with me.  that is their right and I respect that. However, to the point, Jews are also covered by the saving grace of Jesus Christ.  There are Jews who have become Christians.  This brings up another question I still have to ponder:  why is there so  much anti-Semitism?  Why do people hate Jews?  I do not hate Jews.  I consider them to be like anyone else, sinners we all are.
