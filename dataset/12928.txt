From: sbrenner@cbnewsb.cb.att.com (scott.d.brenner) Subject: what is the Difference Between an M.D. and a D.O.?  My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our first child (due June 15th).  We interviewed a young doctor last week and were very impressed with her.  However, I discovered that she is actually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a  Doctor of  Osteopathy  (D.O.).  what is the difference?  I believe the pediatrician *I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he did not seem different from any other doctor i have seen over the years.  My dictionary says that osteopathy is  a medical therapy that emphasizes manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought to cause disease and inhibit recovery.   Jeez, this sounds like chiropractic.  I remember getting shots and medicine from *my* pediatrician D.O., and do not remember any   manipulative techniques .  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the real, practical difference between an M.D. and a D.O.  Also, i am interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who follows one or the other medical philosophy.

Sorry for the cross-posting, but i am hoping there is some expertise here.  a T d H v A a N n K c S e  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Scott D.
