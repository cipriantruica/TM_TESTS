Not any more.  About 2 years ago they all closed. When Ramco/Electronics city closed, it took weeks and many dumpsters to clear everything out (so I heard). There are a few places that sell connectors and phone wires, but no chips, capacitors or discrete stuff.  Sylvan/Wellington is still on Broadway and Canal, but they are not cheap, and not surplus.  it is mostly a TV repairman is store.  -- Jeffrey Jonas jeffj@panix.com --  Jeffrey Jonas  jeffj@panix.com
