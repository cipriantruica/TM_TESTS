If you think you are going to decide anything for me, you had better be  carrying a badge and a gun.  Who made you capable of determining if there is  no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere ?  Why do you find  it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own  business?  If someone is minding their own business, I will give them all the room they want, and i shall try to make things easy for them, even letting them in in front of me if they ask politely (with a directional). On the other hand, if someone like you decides they want to block me and be a general asshole, you can bet your ass that i shall make life as  miserable as possible for you, as long as it does not affect anyone else who has minding their own business.   They have a phrase to describe someone like you: Self Appointed Traffic Police. Just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong.  >As a rule of philosophy, I do not feel particularly sorry when somebody gets  >offed by his own stupidity, but It does worry me when some idiot is in a position >to cash in my chips, too. > >                                                           H.H.
