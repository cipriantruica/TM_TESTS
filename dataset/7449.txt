From: jkjec@westminster.ac.uk (Shazad Barlas) Subject: Re: Alarm systems: are they worthwhile?  Talking about car alarms, there are certain cars in this country that are  only insurable if they are fitted with a Vecta alarm. we are talking Coswoths and Porsches and stuff. Just before they (the insurance companies) decided to  make this move, they insisted that the car be fitted with a Scorpion alarm ( now they have changed to the Vecta)... so everyone who has spent $$$ on fitting  the Scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the Vecta system.  Sad huh? :-(\t\t\t\t\t...Shaz...
