Ahhh yes, Andrew, we meet again...  ...no, not  istealing\' the oil, just draining it as to leave me stranded.  >C\'mon, you think a vandal\'ll do that?!  Let me guess, you are from Hudson Ohio??  >that is absolutely ridiculous!  Get out and see the world.    IF  I were the vandal, and I really hated someone, maybe someone who knew something about cars, of course I would look for ANY types of valves I could undo.  Especially, special oil drain plugs, and radiator petcocks.  As well as putting bad things in the gas...  While I would never vandalize someone is car, IF I were to, it would probably be the \'time bomb\' approach, and i am sure i am not the only one who thinks that way...   steve
