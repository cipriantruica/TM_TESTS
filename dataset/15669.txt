Howver, there are situations where firearms are the most effective means of self protection.  What other means do you propose as equally effective?   > >> Freedoms and rights are not dependent on public opinion, necessity, or >> scientific scrutiny. > >\tNew to this planet ?

Alas, I was speaking of principle.  Without principle, all attempts at republican forms of gov\'t are futile.  There are times when public and political opinion are contrary to principle, which is why we have a Constitution which enumerates gov\'t powers and presumes certain rights.  A major reason for this was to prevent a tyranny of the majority.  > >> No arguments against RKBA can withstand scientific scrutiny. > >\tThey do not have to.

This is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought, not immediate perception.  Of course, it does not always work that way. Fortunately, while there are no guarantees, logic sometimes does prevail.  And, if not, there are still means for correction.   As far as  enough active voters  are concerned, that is still an open question until the vote is made.  > >> How do you intend to  isilence\' RKBA supporters? > >\tTalk all you want.

You portray a possible scenario for the future.  But, how will you silence RKBA supporters right now?  As long as public debate is allowed, such debate will continue. If we allow public debate to be restricted or denied, then we will get a gov\'t we deserve.  Al [standard disclaimer]
