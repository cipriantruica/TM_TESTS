There was no problem in installation. But there was a problem in invoking \'xinit\'. When I invoke \'xinit\', there is a error message as follows:  giving up. xinit: unable to connect to X server xinit: No such process (errno 3): Server error.  i am a navice. So I do not know the reason why I get this message. Please help me. I am waiting for your help.  Thanks for reading this mail.  -Park Jang Ho  (jhpark@kdb.snu.ac.kr)
