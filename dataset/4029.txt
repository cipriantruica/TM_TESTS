Subject: Put ex. syquest in Centris 610? From: kmoffatt@cstp.umkc.edu  I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris. . . I was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions.  My PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the outside of the case.  Where do I connect this switch??  Can the computer just  tell  with internal drives?   \tI noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I did not look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that is soldered onto the motherboard?  Would that cause problems? \tOne last question!  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?   the drive is front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the drive is panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone is cases).  Should I just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?  Ans are welcomed!  Thanks! Keith Moffatt KMOFFATT@VAX2.CSTP.UMKC.EDU
