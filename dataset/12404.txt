More than Talk:  From the FCC Rules:  73.4250 Subliminal Perception:  (a) See Public Notice, FCC 74-78, dated January 24, 1974, 44 FCC 2d, 1016; 39 Fr 3714, January 29, 1974. (b) See FCC Information Bulletin,  Subliminal Projection  (sic, at least in my rules service copy of the rules), dated November 1977.  Since I do not have either old copies of the Federal Register or the Information Bulletin around, I cannot tell you what you cannot do on TV ( or radio) but I seem to remember this being an unnecisarily hot subject in the late \'70s.   Practically speaking, I dont have too much trouble seeing the one frame edits in MTV promos,  badly scratched or torn single frames in films and such, but maby that is just because the contrast between the single frame and the surrounding material was significant.  I never believed in the one-frame type of SP being real.    On the other hand, the Coca-Cola or Brand (insert desired name here) beer cans conveniently placed so the brand name is visible in the movie you just watched, that is another story, and if your TV station or network was paid by the beer company for the privilege of doing that, there has to be a  Promotional Consideration paid by ...) or similar message included with the program; but if the TV station bought the movie already edited that way from the film company and did not get any of the payment for  brand visibility  that the film company got, then they do not have to run the message. >  >       A few years ago, some junior person at an advertising agency > re-invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape > with single-frame messages.
