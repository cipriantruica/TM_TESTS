I have a good friend whose lifestyle is very sinful.  Do I hate the things she does to herself and others?  Yes.  Do I hate her?  Absolutely not.  In fact, she tells me repeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world.  I care about her very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life.  it is very easy to fall into the progression you describe above.  i have felt it with my friend more than once.  There is a very important  part of Christianity that you have overlooked above and makes it possible to  love the sin but hate the sinner.   Before I look at someone else is life and sin, I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see in *me* as I see in others, probably more.  Self-righteousness is contradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you describe happen.  If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say,  Wretched man that I am!  [Romans 7:24 (NASB)], that Christian will be able to love the sinner and hate the sin.  If we have the attitude of the Pharisee  who said,  I thank Thee that I am not like other men...  [Luke 18:11 (NASB)], we will hate both.    -- Scott at Brandeis  \t But God demonstrates His      The Lord bless you, and keep you; \t own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you, \t while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you; \t Christ died for us. \t       the Lord lift up His countenance on you, \t\t\t\t       and give you peace.  \t\t-- Romans 5:8 [NASB]\t\t-- Numbers 6:24-26 [NASB]
