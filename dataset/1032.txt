I guess it was lost in all those subdirs :-) >Thanks for correcting me.  It does not sound very appealing though, only >320x200?  i am glad it was not something major I missed.  Tommy Frandsen is VGAlib (which is probably what you are talking about) will do the standard VGA modes, some tweaked modes and then the Tseng ET4000 Super VGA modes. I have an ET4000 and i am viewing GIF is at 640x480/256 (I have a lousy/small monitor) with dpg-view on Linux. I think I had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it use the ET4k modes.  VGAlib is sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGA support; each mode is an array of register values and there is a program that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current mode. have not tried it though...  (Btw, my version of VGAlib is 1.2.)  --  kennu@mits.mdata.fi Try Linux, a free UNIX by Linus Torvalds for 386+ is. Read comp.os.linux (or ask me by email if you like) for more information.
