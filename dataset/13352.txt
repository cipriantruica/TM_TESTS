I am recalling this from memory but I think i am fairly close (by the way it was GREAT!)  1 \tpint of plain yogurt  1/2\tmed. sized cucumber finely shredded 3\tcloves of garlic (more or less by taste) 1/4 tsp\tdill weed  The yogurt is dumped into a strainer lined with a coffee filter and allowed to drain at least 2 hours (you can adjust the consistancy of the sauce by increasing this time up to 24 hours)  The shredded cuc is drained the same way  Mix it all together and let it steep for at least 2 hours (it is better the next day) and enjoy!
