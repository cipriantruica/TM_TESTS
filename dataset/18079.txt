There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase incrementally.         (BTW, what is different between Canada is tax and most of Europe is that makes it  visible? )  >and >force an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax >rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could >be increased only via a national referendum.         This would require a constitutional amendment, and Congress enjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that. (Besides, with the 2/3 majority necessary to pull that off you had  have a difficult time  forcing  anything like that.)  >Why not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile... >shift the tax burden from investment to consumption, and get >health care reform, and a frozen low top marginal tax rate >all in one fell swoop.         Primarily because it is a practical impossibility to  freeze  tax rates.         However, this is something that bothers me.  we are always talking about  consumer confidence  and  consumer spending  as gauges for the economy.  If they really are important, would not shifting taxes to consumption provide a disincentive to spend money?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.
