That includes suicides.  Since it has been shown in other countries that suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for doing oneself in (studies include some done/published in Japan, Canada, Austria, Norway), suicides ought not be included in the count.  If this is done, the number of vehicle-related deaths greatly exceeds that of firearms-related deaths in Texas.  >*I* should not suffer because of others....  Certainly not.  >We all agree on this one, BUT we also live in a sociaty and therefor >we will have to give up *SOME* of our \'freedom\' (Note the \'\').  Why?  Unless it is doing something that directly hurts someone else, what is the point?  (Otherwise, you had better stop operating all motor vehicles, since the price of operating them *greatly* exceeds the cost in lives of firearms.  >One state (do not remember which, Texas??) tried to impose a rule that you could >only buy ONE gun each MONTH. Think you all know what happened.....  WEll, it is been done at least twice.  South (North?) Carolina did it a few years back...and watched its crime rate relative to the rest of the country rise quite a bit.  Virginia just passed the law...no word yet on what the results will be, but i had be willing ot bet that a reduction in crime rates will not be one of them.  >I respect the right to defend yourself, but that right should not inflict on >other people.  Self-defense does not  inflict  on other people (except perhaps the criminal who has tried to do you damage, and maybe indirectly on future potential victims who might not become victims).    --  ------------------------------------------------------- | Some things are too important not to give away      | | to everybody else and have none left for yourself.  | |------------------------ Dieter the car salesman-----|
