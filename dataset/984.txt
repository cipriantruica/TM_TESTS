From: hugo@hydra.unm.edu (patrice cummings) Subject: polygon orientation in DXF?   Hi.  i am writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3D graphics program i have written.  My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order.  i have used 3D Concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn.  Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert, but if I do not know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF does not handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...  Thanks in advance for any help,  Patrice hugo@hydra.unm.edu
