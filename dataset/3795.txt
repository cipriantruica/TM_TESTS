From: choo@ecs.umass.edu Subject: TechWorks -- What You Say?    Greetings!!  \ti am planning to upgrade my Mac IIsi:  \t\t(1) from the present 5Megs to 17Megs; \tand\t(2) add a Math-Coprocessor.  \tTechnology Works, of Austin (Texas) comes quite highly recommended by  some Mac magazines.  I was just wonderring if anyone could share with me  anything about Tech Works (both good and bad experiences); or give any advice about other mail-order companies that I may consider.  \tYour reply would be very much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.  Sincerely Peter Choo choo@sigma.ecs.umass.edu
