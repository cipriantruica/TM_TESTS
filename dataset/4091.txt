From: bill@lhotse.hao.ucar.edu (Bill Roberts) Subject: Upgrading PB170 Memory  I  have one of the original Powerbook 170 is (with 4Mb of Ram) and find that 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work.  So, what is the best way to get the maximum RAM for this unit, and what is it going to cost me? i am hoping I can get the latest and best info from real users by posting  to this group.  Thanks in advance, --Bill
