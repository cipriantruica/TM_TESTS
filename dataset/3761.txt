From: bruceg@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Bruce Gimble) Subject: built in video  I have MANY questions for all you experts out there pertaining to apple is built-in video.      Do all macs that have built-in video have the ability to use VGA monitors?   If so/if not, which macs have this capability?   Can they drive SVGA as well?   how big of a vga monitor can they drive?   how can you tell if an unlabeled monitor is VGA?  By the pinouts?     if so, what should it look like?  Particularly, i am interested in knowing if the si or ci drive VGA, as well as the LC is capabilities in driving VGA/SVGA  Thanks!!!
