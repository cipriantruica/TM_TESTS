I also ask myself the question  Why did they plan for so many months.  Why was this so important to them?  What was the government really up to? Why did they seal the warrant?  Were they after Koresh or were they after       the first and second amendments, among others?  >  > We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.
