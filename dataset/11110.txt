There have not been any, and are unlikely to ever be any. In some Socialist dictatorships, you cannot, whilst in some socialist democracies (such as France or Australia) you can. Of course, some people may disagree about France & Australia being socialist...  >it, (or rather, you are complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.    Yet.  >(Or, rather, if they are shooting at me, they have real bad aim.  (:-) ) > >GUESS WHAT PEOPLE?  You live in one of the few countries in the world >where a person can complain without getting shot at.    In some circumstances. I was at a public meeting last night (in the USA), where a protester, who was very nice and calm, and just said before the speaker started to beware of his opinions, was forced out of the meeting by two armed policemen.  There are a lot of things that one cannot do in the USA. You may not notice them, but as an Australian visitor, I notice them.  >People are always complaining that somebody did this wrong, or somebody >did that wrong, or whatever.

I hope that is still true in a few years time. Because it did not just happen...it required concious effort.  >So let us talk about it, get some action going, decide what is going on.  >But let us not overreact!    Of course do not over react --- but do not under react.  Andrew. Disclaimer: All my opinions are my own, and do not represent the society for the conservation of momentum or any other group.
