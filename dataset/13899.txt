It may be that they just did not mention it, or that they actually have not  thought about it.  I got the vague impression from their mission proposal that they were not taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  They seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without  explaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  The only application I remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon.  that is great, but they do not explain why it cannot be done robotically.   >> Hrumph.
