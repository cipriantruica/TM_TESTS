To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for  This is a little peculiar way of putting it, SDIO is budget this year was, what, $3-4 billion?

I applaud the SDIO for funding DC-X devlopment and I hope it works, and, no, launcher development is not NASAs primary goal either, IMHO they are supposed to provide the enabling technology research for others to do launcher development, and secondarily operate such launchers as they require - but that is just me.  |  Steinn Sigurdsson\t|I saw two shooting stars last night\t\t| |  Lick Observatory\t|I wished on them but they were only satellites\t| | steinly@lick.ucsc.edu |Is it wrong to wish on space hardware?\t\t| |  standard disclaimer \t|I wish, I wish, I wish you had care - B.B. 1983\t|
