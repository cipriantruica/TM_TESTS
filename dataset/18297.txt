KS, I see you are wanting Malcolm is response. Allow me one last inter- jection then please:  Distinguishing among the religious Jews, you have excepted the Messianic for obvious reasons. Specifically, are you saying it is these religious  Jews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy,  rather than by faith, who will not agree?  Orthodox Jews?    As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains  unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often  look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree. For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, i am not so  sure the atheists can be counted out.   For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham, or David in accepting God is Word? Is the particular covenant to which one adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it depends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might  understand why I think it is premature to assert who will and will not agree.     | -- J --    |    | stephen
