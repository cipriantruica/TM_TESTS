From: choman@rajeesh.WPI.EDU (Charles Stanley Homan) Subject: RBI Question  Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI is? This is the situation that brought the question up:  The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5-1.  The Mariners had the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the fielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.    Now, without a judgement call (and I do not think there is one), this is an RBI for the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be  defensive indifference , since it does not really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point.  (I know, I can think of several  If the Mariners stole third and second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third, he would not have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and maybe he therefore cannot make the throw to first to get the last out, etc... scenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when you are down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)  The point is that the batter (IMO) should not get  credit  (an RBI) for utterly failing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not trade an out for one run.  What do you guys think?  \t\t\t\tRegards, \t\t\t\tBurke (Charles S. Homan) \t\t\t\tchoman@wpi.wpi.edu \t\t\t\tGo Red Sox!!!  (11-3) \t\t\t\tGo Rocket! (3-0)
