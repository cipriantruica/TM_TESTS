Subject: Burzynski is  Antineoplastons  From: jschwimmer@wccnet.wcc.wesleyan.edu (Josh Schwimmer)  i have recently listened to a tape by Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, in which he  claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti- cancer properties that he names antineoplastons.  Burzynski says that his  work has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorable  responses of his subjects during clinical trials.  What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski is research?  He  paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an  intolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judge  his claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH is Department of  Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski is  work.  Their budget is so small that I imagine they would not investigate a  treatment that did not seem promising.  Any opinions on Burzynski is antineoplastons or information about the current  status of his research would be appreciated.  -- Joshua Schwimmer jschwimmer@eagle.wesleyan.edu
