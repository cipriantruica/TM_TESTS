From: hannguye@nosc.mil (Han N. Nguyen) Subject: Action Translation Table implementation   Hello,   Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows in a number of applications.  We are trying to use action translation tables to implement this.  We have only succeeded by assigning the translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single application.  The Xt calls we make are included below.  It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations, and also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications.  If someone could describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated.  Platform: Sun Sparc w/ X11R4 & Motif 1.1.4  ***********************************************************************  static XtActionsRec actionsTable[] = {         { up , do_up},         { right , do_right},         { middle , do_middle},         { left , do_left},         { down , do_down}, \t{ bye , quit}, };  static char defaultTranslations[] =  \t\t KP_8: up()  n  \t\t KP_6: right()  n  \t\t KP_5: middle()  n  \t\t KP_4: left()  n  \t\t KP_2: down()  n  \t\t KP_1: bye() ;   XtTranslations\ttrans_table, trans_table2;  (. . .)      XtAddActions(actionsTable, XtNumber(actionsTable));     trans_table = XtParseTranslationTable(defaultTranslations);      widget = XtCreateManagedWidget( msg , xmPushButtonWidgetClass, \t\tform, wargs, n);      XtOverrideTranslations(widget, trans_table);  ***********************************************************************
