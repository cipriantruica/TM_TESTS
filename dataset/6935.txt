Of course shooting someone because they throw a rock at your car is out of the question, but what if they disabled your car with their rock and then wanted to come kill/rape/rob/beat/ or otherwise harm you, your wife, kids?   \tI think you would like the power to defend yourself in this situation, would not you?  Or is it that you value the lives of such rock throwers more than your own or those of your family?   \tdo not think it could not happen to you.  From the sounds of it here it has happened to a few people.    \tPlease do not misunderstand.  The only justification for using deadly force on someone, is that if you do not, it will mean your own  death or grave bodily harm.  I am far far away from supporting vilante justice or anything like that..  \tOh, and if you mean to be funny, please add the appropriate :-) \t Followups to talk.politics.guns please...  we are getting a bit off track here....  -------   Steve Syck        syck5280@miller.cs.uwm.edu        --------   \t
