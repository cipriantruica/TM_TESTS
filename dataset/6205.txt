From: jimd@psg.com (Jim Dorman) Subject: Spring Cleaning Sale!   Time once again to clean out the ol\' closet.  Some stuff is up for offers, some is not.  Please read carefully.   In the MAKE OFFER department:  \tWordPerfect 5.0, upgrade copy.  Includes all disks and all upgrade \tmanuals.  Best offer.  \tBalance of Power, 1992 edition, for the Amiga.  With manual and reg. \tcard.  Best offer.   In the FOR SALE department:  \tTechnics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel STEREO tape deck.  Because \tit is auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette \tdeck does, so it is not very good for splice-type editing.  However, \tI have used it effectively in  tape studio  applications for mastering, \tand it works great.  3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7  reels. \tDual lighted VU meters with record indicators.  Full auto-reverse \tcapable (and the mechanism works, too!).  Adjustable sound on sound, \tand socket for remote control (I do not know where you had find one, but \tthey used to make \'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.  This unit \tis in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got \tit--works perfectly.  \tPrice:  $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below).   \tPanasonic KX-P1624 printer.  24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both \ttext and graphics modes.  Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff \tyou expect when buying like-new merchandise.  i am selling it because I \tnow have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the \tKX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.  \tPrice:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.   \tExcalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen \twrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  i have got too \tmany cues as it is, and do not need this one.  Hits nicely, is very \tstraight and in excellent condition.  \tPrice:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft) \tavailable for an additional $40.00.   TRADES:  I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now, so if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list:  \tAmiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate \tDOS and Workbench.  \t1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.  \tAmiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).  \tIBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one is  \ttouchy, as I have a full-height and do not have room for more unless \tI swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a \tgood ST-4096 in the deal.  \tIntel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem.   This is not a complete list, but it is close.  If you have got something way off the track of this list, it is probably not going to interest me at this point. Email responses, please.
