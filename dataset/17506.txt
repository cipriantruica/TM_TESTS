EDT \t      \t     Q\t  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson is  protest today? \t      \t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it is an informational protest.   I think it is fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago,  which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase  minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we  should.  i am encouraged by Don Baylor is appointment out in Colorado.   And I think it is time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it is  a legitimate issue, and I think it is -- like I said, it is an  informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to  the game.  So, I think it is good. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you think they are moving fast enough? \t      \t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first  step.  And I think you shall see some movement now.  And I think it is an  issue that deserves some attention, and they are obviously going to  give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will  highlight the issue.  So I think it is fine. \t      \t     Q\t  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate  on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they will be able to break  that and get cloture? \t      \t     THE PRESIDENT:  I do not know, we are working at it.  I  mean, it is a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one  of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you  know, this is a -- it is just a political power play.  In the Senate  the majority does not rule.  it is not like the country.  it is not  like the -- it is not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they  can stop majority rule.  And that is what they are doing.  There are a  lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote  for the stimulus program but there is enormous partisan political  pressure not to do it.   \t      \t     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when  no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an  economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they are  willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston  and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  it is very  sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in  a hurry based on local priorities, and it is one that the Republicans  had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the  program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots  level, governors and senators.  I just think it is real sad that they  have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep  Americans out of work.  I think it is a mistake. \t      \t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END11:50 A.M. EDT
