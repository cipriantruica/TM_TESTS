Any experiences or opinions from people who have used >the NEC 5FG would be appreciated since I want to get one right after >my exams are all done (ie: about a week from now).  \tI have a 5FG and think it is great. I have not seen the Nanao is so I cannot compare, but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is *extremely* good. i have used other Trinitron monitors (e.g. a Sun SS2 color monitors, which is a 19  Trinitron), and think the 5FG is at least as good, perhaps brighter, and has *none* of these silly horizontal lines running across. \tBTW, I could be wrong, but I thought that the 5FGe is slower as well as missing ACCUCOLOR. It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5FG can.  \t\t\tCheers, \t\t\tDan Ts\'o                         Div.
