May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this??  The ground is supposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggest looks good on paper, it is dangerous to rely on the same wire for power and protection.  it had never meet code, and if you now own the property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilities you do not want, and if you _do not_ now own it, well...  there is a  wiring  FAQ that I think addresses this.  I believe an alternative is use of a GFCI, but i am really not sure what current code allows in this area.  The GFCI senses alternate (unwanted) current paths, and does not rely on a specific protective ground wire, at least not beyond the GFCI in the protected circuit.  GFCI breakers are available (but expensive).
