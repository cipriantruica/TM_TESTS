As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb, you can figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods. (The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products that sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sell thousands of units/year will be at the high end.  I suspect cellular phones are in the middle).  This implies that adding a $25 chip would increase the cost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%.  I do not think you shall get a lot of consumer support for this.   -tony  >>usual disclaimer<<
