I think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in  Conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional  names.  Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the game; IMO it is a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners _hope_  will have an effect.  And it does not say much for the mentality of  anybody it works on, either.    >Another thing that bothers me is the points system.

The points system is fine, if everybody at all times has played the same number of games.  Since this is almost never the case, winning percentage is the way to go.  I do not particularly care if it  is an  American  thing either, if it works.     -- dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca
