From: calzone@athena.mit.edu Subject: Legality of placebos?    How is it that placebos are legal?  It would seem to me that if, as a patient, you purchase a drug you have been prescribed and it is just sugar (or whatever), there is a few legal complications that arise:  \t1.  If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you are not given accepted treatment for it, it seems like intentional medical malpractice.  \t2. A placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?)  \t3. Getting what you pay for.  (Deceptive  bait and switch  to an extreme...).  False advertising  (what if McDonalds did not put 100% pure beef in their hamburgers?)   \tSo i am mystified.  Are these assumptions erred?  If they are not, why the hell can a doctor knowingly or unknowingly prescribe a placebo?  Thanks calzone
