From: santac@aix.rpi.edu (Christopher James Santarcangelo) Subject: FORSALE:  1982 Yamaha Seca 650 Turbo  I do not want to do this, but I need money for school.  This is a very snappy bike.  It needs a little work and I do not have the money for it.  Some details:  \t~19000 miles \tMitsubishi turbo \tnot asthetically beautiful, but very fast! \tOne of the few factory turboed bikes... not a kit! \tMust see and ride to appreciate how fun this bike is!  I am asking $700 or best offer.  The bike can be seen in Bennington, Vermont.  E-mail for more info!  Thanks, Chris santac@rpi.edu
