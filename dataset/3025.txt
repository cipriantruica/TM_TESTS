Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  : Why do not you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? : You can quote SCSI specs till you are blue in the face, but if they : exceed the ISA bus capability, then what is the point?

No, that is the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  i have got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  it is pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I have not seen IDE drives cheaper.  : The original CGA cart back in \'84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down : in price, mainly because we are talking about PC is and not Sun is or Sparc : or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions : of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to : come down in price.  No, actually, we are talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you had find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  : I will not argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented : data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS is when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you had want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list: \t1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them  \tconcurrently. \t2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac \tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice \twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go) \t3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For \tinstance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor \t212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will \twork no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the \ttermination, plug it in, and away it goes. \t4.  I have a problem with IDE is mutual exclusion - I notice that \tthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is \tquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c: \tto d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very \tnoticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that i have noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we have got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that i have added to my PC.  i have now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.
