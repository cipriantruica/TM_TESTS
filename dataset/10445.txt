I have absolutely no recollection who was on my team.   I picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season, and   then never touched the roster again.  I got wrapped up in my own  money  pool   and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew   btw).  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and   maybe John MacLean.  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well.  Out of   curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my   amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to   finsh 79th!  i am not sure what that implies for those who finished below me   :)    Ciao.
