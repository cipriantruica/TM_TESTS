Is (was? :-( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with molded plastic teeth? i have only tried it on the coiled nylon type, and it does not take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing it (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after spreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not the usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so they were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the adjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right amount of Zipper Squish (TM).  >Result: I now know that noplace in Spokane will even _consider_ trying >to repair a broken zipper-closer-thingy, which must be a $0.30 part >which needs a $20 tool to install.  i have had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the Accessory Ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of charge. I do not know what brand of zippers HG uses, but parts ARE available for YKK is plastic zippers. Replacement was pretty simple, just break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps the pull from coming off the top end. Slide on the new zipper pull. Then crimp on (Vice-Grips again!) a replacement zipper stop.  You might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement parts.  Oh, for what it is worth, the coil-type zippers on the Eclipse tankbag are also YKK. --  Blaine Gardner   Evans & Sutherland bgardner dsd.es.com
