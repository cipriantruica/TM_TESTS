From: robert@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Robert Kennedy) Subject: Battery storage -- why not charge and store dry?  So it looks like i am going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage for a few months, starting several months from now, and i am already contemplating how to do it so they are as easy to get going again as possible. I have everything under control, I think, besides the batteries. I know that if I buy a $50.00 Battery Tender for each one and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage, they will be fine. But i am not sure that is necessary. i have never heard anyone discussing this idea, so maybe there is some reason why it is not so great. But maybe someone can tell me.  Would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the electrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the container, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? Then it would seem that when the bikes come out of storage, I could put the electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully charged. what is wrong with this?  On a related, but different note for you Bay Area Denizens, was not there someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back? Who was it? Is there still any of it left?  Thanks for any and all help!  \t-- Robert
