Well, it is obvious that you *do not* attempt, otherwise you would be aware that they *do not* all  loudly [claim] to be the One True Christian .  i have tried to avoid using the phrase  is/is not christian  because of these ownership issues; instead, i have tried the phrase  Nicene christianity  in an attempt to identify the vast majority of  christianity  which has roughly similar viewpoints on the core theological issues.  The JWs do not fall within this group and in fact espouse a position known as Arianism, which is rejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well. --  C.
