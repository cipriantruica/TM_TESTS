So that still leaves the door totally open for Khomeini, Hussein et rest. They could still be considered true Muslims, and you cannot judge them, because this is something between God and the person.  You have to apply your rule as well with atheists/agnostics, you do not know their belief, this is something between them and God.  So why the hoopla about Khomeini not being a real Muslim, and the hoopla about atheists being not real human beings?  Cheers, Kent --- sandvik@newton.apple.com.
