From: Dan Wallach  Subject: FAQ: Typing Injuries (4/4): Software Monitoring Tools [monthly posting]  Archive-name: typing-injury-faq/software Version: 1.8, 7th December 1992  This FAQ is actually maintained by Richard Donkin . I post it, along with the other FAQ stuff.  If you have questions, you want to send mail to Richard, not me.  -- Dan     \t\t    Software Tools to help with RSI \t\t    -------------------------------   This file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI. This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches...   Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.  I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them.     Richard Donkin                            Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk               Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) Fax: +44 71 251 2853  Changes in this version:       Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool       for Windows.   TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you do not have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.        Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)     Available from: \tBright Star \tTel: +1 (206) 451 3697     Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows     Description: \tProvides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.  \tWarns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations \ton posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best  \twith sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible \tto record your own messages to warn of break.       Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)     Available from: \tMedia Vision \tTel: +1 (510) 226 2563     Platforms: PC     Description: \tA sound card to plug into your PC parallel port. \tIncludes \'At Your Service\'.       Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)     Available from: \tEscape Ergonomics, Inc \t1111 W. El Camino Real \tSuite 109 \tMailstop 403 \tSunnyvale, CA \tTel: +1 (408) 730 8410     Platforms: DOS     Description: \tAimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take \tbreaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or \tafter a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier. \tIt gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from \ta set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work \tyou do - data entry, word processing, information processing. \tExercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on \thow to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.  \tCHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use  \tto learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information \ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer. \tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.  \tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then \twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear \tuseful when used with Windows.  \tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.      Comments: \tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better \tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to \tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff \tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers, \tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company  \tto pay up for RSI management tools.        Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)     Available from: \tRAN Enterprises \tOne Woodland Park Dr. \tHaverhill, MA  01830, US \tTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)     Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]     Description: \tAimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take \tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally \tdisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are \tanimated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the \tcorrect rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training  \texercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions \tyou do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help  \ton workplace ergonomics.    \tQuote from their literature:  \t EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic \tsets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work \tall parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent \tRepetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve \tyour peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these \thelp you to become more relaxed and productive.    \t The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C. \tGodnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup \tfor a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to \tpromote healthy and efficient computer use.  \t \tCost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts \tfor resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments: \tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say \tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it \tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it \tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which \tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on \tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure \twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has \tone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not \trequire any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from: \tVisionary Software \tP.O. Box 69447 \tPortland, OR  97201, US \tTel: +1 (503) 246-6200     Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)     Description: \tAimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break \twith dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises \tto do during breaks, and information on configuring your \tworkstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59; \tquantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is \tbought in from another company, apparently; not sure how \tequivalent this is to the Mac version. \t \tThe Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher  \tMagazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful  \t2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with  \treferences.       Tool: StressFree (commercial software, free usable demo)     Available from: \tLifeTime Software \tP.O. Box 87522 \tHouston \tTexas 77287-7522, US \tTel: 800-947-2178 (US only) \tFax: +1 (713) 474-2067 \tMail: 70412.727@compuserve.com  \tDemo (working program but reduced functions) available from: \t    Compuserve: Windows Advanced Forum, New Uploads section, or  \t\t\tHealth and Fitness Forum, Issues At Work section.  \t    Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)      Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway)     Description: \tAimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take \tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times).  \tDisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are \tanimated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the \tcorrect rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones \tare included to some extent.  Online help.  \tVersion 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based \ton this.  \tCost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.                 Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each. \t      (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).       Comments: \tI have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface \tdesign is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual. \texpensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only \ttool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it \ton your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers! \tDoes not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does  \thave the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence, \twhich is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from: \tEmail to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk \tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description: \tThis is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you \tto stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously \ttyping.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check \tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you \tcan start typing again.    \tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing \ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you \tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information \tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.    \tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode), \tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message \t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman   \thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for  \tX, Zephyr and Mach.  \tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk \t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach, \tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give  \tfeedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from: \tVarious sources     Platforms: Various     Description: \tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming \tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool. \tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit \ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to \tthe screen.  \tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and \tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI is \'load=\' line so \tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you \twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am. \tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter \t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break \tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat  \tfor the next appointment.  \tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes \tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this \tfile on your \'run=\' line, as above, and you will then, with \ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments \twith RSI exercises.  \tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.  \tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job \tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will \tdepend a lot on your operating system.  \tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing  \tyourself to take a break if you cannot get hold of a suitable RSI  \tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to \twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating \tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from: \tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description: \tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable \tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either \tmanually or automatically.    \tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you \tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from \ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great \tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you \tare doing. \t     Comments: \tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to \tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which \tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left \tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been \tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.  \tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but \tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible \twarning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from: \tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (do not know which ones)     Description: \tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings. \tOnly works through tty is (so, you can use it with a terminal or \tan xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from: \tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c \tAlso built into Windows 3.x.      Description: \tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout \tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent \tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since  \tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)    --  Dan Wallach                One of the most attractive features of a Connection dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces Office#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet.  -- CM Paris Ref.
