From: rxg3321@ultb.isc.rit.edu (R.X. Getter) Subject: How do I put an HD on an XT?  This may be a dumb question, but I need to put a hard drive on my father is PC/XT, either MFM, RLL, or IDE. I know how to hook it up, but how do I tell the computer the geometry of the drive. On my 386, you set it in the BIOS, but I doubt that is how it is done on an XT. I thought it might be software with the controller card, but the IDE card for XT is that I saw did not come with any. Also, how do I low level format it once it is on the computer? (Assuming a drive which needs formatting)  advTHANKSance,  Rob rxg3321@ultb.isc.rit.edu
