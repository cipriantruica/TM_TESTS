That is because your premises are wrong from the word  Go .  You claim that Christianity is based on blind faith, but this simply is not so.  Just look at the current thread on the evidence for Jesus\' resurrection for evidence that Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.  Furthermore, you say that Christians hold to their beliefs  regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary.   Without any evidence to support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem  argument.  Mind you, I do not mean this as a personal attack.  i am merely pointing out the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion. It would make much more sense if you could prove that all Christians do  base their belief on empty nothings, and that they do ignore all evidence to  the contrary.  Only then can you expect your attack to make sense.   --  Virgilio  Dean  Velasco Jr, Department of Electrical Eng\'g and Applied Physics  \t CWRU graduate student, roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee      Bullwinkle, that man is intimidating a referee!    |    My boss is a      Not very well.
