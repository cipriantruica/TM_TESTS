From: mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Michael D. Walker) Subject: Re: Question about Virgin Mary   \tTwo follow up is to Mark is last posting:  \t1.  As far as current investigations, the Church recently declared the \t    crying statue and corresponding messages from Mary at Akita, \t    Japan as approved (I found this out about a month ago.)  \t2.  Again in the proof department, start with the appearances of Mary \t    at Fatima.  Among other things, there were pictures taken of the \t     miracle of the sun  that appeared in some major American newspaper \t    (The New York Times, I believe) as well as most of the major \t    European newspapers.    \t    I could talk (or post) for hours on this topic, but...  \t\t(I have a thesis to write). \t\t\t\t\t\tGod Bless, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Mike Walker \t\t\t\t\t\t\t  P.S.  Anyone want info, I have more.  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu
