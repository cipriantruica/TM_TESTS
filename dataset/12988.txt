From: michael@iastate.edu (Michael M. Huang) Subject: Re: Is MSG sensitivity superstition?  MSG is common in many food we eat, including Chinese (though some oriental restaurants might put a tad too much in them).  i have noticed that when I go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the time at home :) (but we do not use MSG when we are cooking for ourselves)  So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.  Stick with natural things.  MSG does not do body any good (and possibly harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should be tasted, and do not cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG.  -michael  --  Michael M. Huang               | do not believe what your eyes are  telling you.
