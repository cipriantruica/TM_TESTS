W/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant.  The lockup only occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG.  Mind you, a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving MPG, but the additional mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration (vs. locked converter clutch) than its inherent losses take away.
