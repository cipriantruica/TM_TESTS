First, people should be aware that Brett is (no last name listed)  posts on bit.listserv.politics indicate that he has been   hostile toward GM is hiring policies and to the Moseley verdict  when it came out.  Equal opportunity disagreement, I guess.  :-)  My guess, without seeing the judge is opinion, is that GM is motion  was denied on due diligence grounds.  Otherwise, a party to a  case could always keep one or two semi-credible witnesses in  reserve to spring if they lose.  Not exactly a way to promote  repose.  \t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Reitman   The Uniform Commercial Code protects the innocent purchaser, but it is not a  shield for the sly conniver, the blindly naive, or the hopelessly gullible.
