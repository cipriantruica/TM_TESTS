I think the Bruins are doing the same exact thing the Rangers did, they are playing too tight!!  who has responsibility is it to check Mogilny?  He has gotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many rebounds which are not being cleared by the B is defense.  it is too bad the B is might not get the opportunity to play Pittsburgh again.  I would really enjoy seeing Ulfie get beat up by Neely.  We all hate Ulfie, but would love him on are team!!
