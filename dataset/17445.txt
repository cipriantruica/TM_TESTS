I M CHANGING MY NAME TO CHRYSLER (Tom Paxton, 1980)  Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight What the dollar used to get us Now will not buy a head of lettus No the economic forecast is not right But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray I caneven glimpse a new and better way And i have devised a plan of action Worked it down to the last fraction And i am going into action here today.  Chorus:    I am changing my name to Chrysler   I am going down to Washington D.C.   I will tell some power broker   What they did for Iacoca   Will be perfectly acceptable to me.   I am changing my name to Chrysler   I am heading for that great receiving line   So when they hand a million grand out   i shall be standing with my hand out   Yes sir i shall get mine  When my creditors are screaming for their dough i shall be proud to tell them all where they can go They won\'y have to scream and holler they will all be paid to the last dollar Where the endless streams of money seam to flow i shall be glad to tell them all what they can do Its just a matter of a simple form or two it is not renumeration it is a liberal education am not you kind of glad that i am in debt to you  Chorus  Since the first first amphibians crawled out of the slime we have been struggling in an unrelenting climb We were hardly up and walking before money started talking And it is sad failure is an awful crime it is been that way for a millennium or two But now it seems there is a different point of view If you are a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic Down in congress there is a safety net for you.  Chorus...    Perhaps Steven Jobs should take Paxton is advice and change his name to Chrysler, or perhaps set himself up as an S&L, maybe Neil Bush could give him a hand?  ================================================================ akasacou@alfred.ccs.carleton.ca  No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn...
