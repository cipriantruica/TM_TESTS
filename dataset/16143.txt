From: Thomas Parsli  Subject: Re: Rewording the Second Amendment (ideas)    Chemical weapons are not concidered a *very* effectiv weapon against millitary forces. On civillians on the other hand....  that is one GOOD reason for banning it.  You need VAST amounts of chemicals to be affective, so the best reason to have/use it is price. (that is why it is called The Poor Mans A-bomb)  Any thoughts on Bio-weapons ??\t  If this discusion is about civillians having chem-weapons; What should they use them on?? Rob a bank ??    \tThis is not a .signature. \tit is merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith \tand to bring down the evil Internet.
