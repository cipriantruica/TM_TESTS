NHL teams cannot afford to import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build their teams around local players. >  >     With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly > only getting worse. >  >     i am all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures > and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.  i had *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but cannot see it happen for some time. there is simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several  crucial  markets like Germany, Italy and France while Sweden and Finland probably cannot afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way American/Canadian fans do. Call it  the Minnesota North Stars  effect: Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local, inexpensive hockey to the NHL. The National Hockey League should love the idea, though. Pan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the American networks likely never will pay.   >     I just do not want them on mine. >  >  >   >   > --  > Richard J.
