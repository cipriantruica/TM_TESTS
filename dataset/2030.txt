Remember the  POLL  that you quoted  >saying that you had seen a 95% of users being satisfied with DOS 6.0?   It was 93%-94%, and actually another msdos team member posted it. Note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know about that, or...  >Care to recall how unbiased the sample set was?   When I heard those numbers I wondered how they got them (having worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller has very little positive to say about the product, I figured it was not from there...) so I wandered over to the marketing folks and asked. And I was told it was from a survey of registered users.  And I  posted that on the net when people asked where the 93% figure came  from.  >That post sure looked like FUD....and coming from a microsoftie  >.... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.  Hmm. I figured, if Chuck posted the numbers, why not include where they came from? (I also find it interesting that postitive info is   fear, uncertainty & doubt .)  >Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very  >unethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success  >of that OS.  ????  I think you have got me confused with someone else. I do not  pretend that MSDOS provides what all people need, or that other OSes (including unix & OS/2) do not provide useful and/or necessary features.  I also do not push people to use MSDOS; I even posted in comp.os.msdos.misc that I suggest _waiting_ before installing a  new os, esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded  during release, unless the sales are a total bomb).  >>I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like, >>members of the BORG. > >That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more  >defensive people in my life.   I am not saying some of us do not get defensive sometimes. Do you *really* think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it?  I just mean we all are not cut out of the same dough with the same cookie cutter. We do not all think alike.  Yeah, ChuckSt and I have some  inside  info on MSDOS - does not mean that everyone else does :)    >Seriously speaking, it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for >MS is actions - most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing. >I am sure that they ARE very talented etc ...
