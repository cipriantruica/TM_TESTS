He did challenge God is authority and got kicked out of heaven.  A lot of the mythology of Satan (he lost the -el suffix when he fell) comes from the Book of Enoch and is not found in the bible.  Read the Book of Enoch, available thru bookstores, or get the book called  Angels: an endangered species  (I think).   -- Steven C.
