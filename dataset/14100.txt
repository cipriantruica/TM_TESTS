Well, i am working on it, but getting a little impatient. So far,  i have made it through Egyptian, Chinese, and Greek cultures, and up through the Rennaisance. But so far, these insights just do not  seem to be gelling. Perhaps it is in an appendix somewhere.  In its own right, though, the history is kind of fun. Lots of  good yarns in there, with varied and interesting characters. And, more to come.
