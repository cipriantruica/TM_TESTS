A placebo is an accepted treatment at times.   >\t2. >A placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?)  Why should it?  Placebos are effective under certain circumstances.  that is why they are used.    Actually, I do not know know anyone who has actually gotten a  sugar pill . I do not know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always labeled, and it is easy enough to find out what is in a pill if you have the name.  it is more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something, just not for what you have.  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most common such placebo.   >\t3. >Getting what you pay for.  (Deceptive  bait and switch  to an extreme...).  False >advertising  (what if McDonalds did not put 100% pure beef in their hamburgers?)  i am not sure what you mean by this.  What do you think you are paying for? you are not entitled to a prescription drug just because you pay for a doctor is appointment.    --   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Jack Hamilton  KD6TTL  jfh@netcom.com  PO Box 281107  SF, CA  94128  USA
