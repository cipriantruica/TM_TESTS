From: maverick@wpi.WPI.EDU (T. Giaquinto) Subject: General Information Request   \tI am looking for any information about the space program. This includes NASA, the shuttles, history, anything!  I would like to know if anyone could suggest books, periodicals, even ftp sites for a novice who is interested in the space program.    \t\t\t\t\tTodd Giaquinto \t\t\t\t\tmaverick@wpi.WPI.EDU \t\t\t\t\t
