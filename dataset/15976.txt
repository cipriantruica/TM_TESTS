I just got through listening to the 10 of the clock news on Channel 4 here in Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after  months of investigation  for their raid.   I could not believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused of stockpiling a bunch of  9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15 and M16 assault rifles . Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had aluminum dust! (Yeah, it is a component of thermite, but so far I have not heard that it is illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)  Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died!  --  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~              |      Die Welt ist alles, was Zerfall ist.     | Peter Cash   |       (apologies to Ludwig Wittgenstein)      |cash@convex.com ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
