The rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast was for prime-time, and that Koresh never even heard it played. was not even tuned in to the radio when it aired -- so no reason to come out.  If later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire  transcript -- i am certain Koresh would think he was at the mercy of evil itself.   As to coming out after Passover, was not that just one of the lawyer is speculations Peter?     | -- J --    |    | stephen
