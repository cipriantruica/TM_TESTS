From: mwgordon@nyx.cs.du.edu (Mike Gordon) Subject: Otronics Attache luggable info needed   Hi all,       i am looking for some info regarding an old pcmade by Otronics (or maybe Oltronics) called the Attache.  This little beauty is an 8088 / Z80 luggable with a 4 or 5 inch screen (monochrome CGA) and 2 360 floppies.       For serial ports it has 2 DB-15 connectors (one is labled \'printer\') and I cannot figure out the pinouts for them.  I also do not know if they  are standard com ports addressable as COM1 and COM2.  I have figured out  that they will only work with DOS 2.something.            If anyone can give me some pointers on this one, i had be most  appreciative.  Please reply via email, as I cannot keep up with news  lately.  (Finals are coming up you know :( )  Thanks much, Mike Gordon   N9LOI  mwgordon@nyx.cs.du.edu
