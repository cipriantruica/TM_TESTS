If you start it with -indirect localhost, it use the loopback adress as it is adress. So when it try to contact another host, this one try to answer on its loopback adress. Not good.  Remember that every machine has the adress 127.0.0.1 on the loopback network.  --  Pierre Verpeaux \tDMT/SEMT/LAMS\t\t(1)69.08.65.42\t
