And what problem are you having with playoff games here in Buffalo???!!!??? there is the Sabres-Bruins, Quebec-Montreal, and whatever ESPN and ABC show, and on opposite nights there is Toronto-Detroit and whatever ESPN(/ABC) shows.  More hockey than a good chunk of North America, either side of the border.  it is wonderful, and there are thousands of folks who had kill to be in your shoes, coverage-wise.     --  Valerie Hammerl \t       John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab  hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside, V085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.
