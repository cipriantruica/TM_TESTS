I know that 3 million dollars is A LOT of money.  I know  Rickey Henderson does not have a career out of baseball.  I know if he  did not have baseball, he would not be making near the money he is now.  I just do not understand how some athlete, who only plays a sport for a  living for millions of dollars, say he is not being paid enough.  If nobody will sign him for his asking price, he will be the one hurting. The A is will still win without him.  Remeber, many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their athletic  ability.  NOTHING.  They are getting paid MUCH more than most hard working citizens, and they are complaining of not enough pay.  I do not have a problem with them making millions.  My problem is when the say they are not being paid enough, when they already get 3 million--also, their numbers get worse.
