From: kturner@copper.denver.colorado.edu (Kathleen J Turner) Subject: Mystery Illness with eye problems   \tA friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically every few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme tiredness followed by:  \t1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows, \tknees, and hips. \t2. generalized muscle pains \t3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears \t4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day \t5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral    retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She         is not diabetic--they checked. \t6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone \t   poles do not appear to be straight) \t7. loss of peripheral vision.  \t \tMany tests have been run and all are normal except for something  called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At times she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg the symptoms become acute again.  \tShe is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming worse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs she has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop it.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in  advance.  Kathy Turner \t
