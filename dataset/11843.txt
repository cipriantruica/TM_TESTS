In fact, >depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter! So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.  As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets, rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.  GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them regularly (using the test button).  Running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check their common sense list.  Please exercise caution. --- \t\t\tGary Gendel Vice President:\t\t\t\tCurrent consulting assignment: Genashor Corp\t\t\t\tMentor Graphics Corporation 9 Piney Woods Drive\t\t\t15 Independence Boulevard Belle Mead, NJ 08502\t\t\tWarren, NJ 07059  phone:\t(908) 281-0164\t\t\tphone:\t(908) 604-0883 fax:\t(908) 281-9607\t\t\temail:\tgaryg@warren.mentorg.com
