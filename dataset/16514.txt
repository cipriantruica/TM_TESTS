Now, how do you explain the attack on Syria in 1967, Syria didnot >enter the war with israel till the 4th day .  Syria had been bombing Israeli settlements from the Golan and sending terrorist squads into Israel for years.  Do you need me to provide specifics? I can.  Why do not you give it up, Hasan?  i am really starting to get tired of your  empty lies.  You can defend your position and ideology with documented facts and arguments rather than the crap you regularly post.  Take an example from someone like Brendan McKay, with whom I do not agree, but who uses logic and documentation to argue his position.  Why must you insist on constantly spouting baseless lies?  You may piss some people off, but that is about it.  You will not prove anything or add anything worthy to a discussion.  Your arguments just  prove what a poor debater you are and how weak your case really is.  All my love, Ed.
