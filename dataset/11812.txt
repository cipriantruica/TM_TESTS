From: swalker@uts.EDU.AU (-s87271077-s.walker-man-50-) Subject: What do Nuclear Site is Cooling Towers do?    I really do not know where to post this question so I figured that this board would be most appropriate. I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that are ever present at nuclear poer sites. They look like cylinders that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they are called \'Cooling Towers\' but what the heck do they cool? I hope someone can help
