Superficially a good answer, but it is not that simple.  An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they have got.  Perhaps it is more accurate to say that there is a Western ethic against Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World, we could not give a shit.  And that goes for the supposed  Pro-Life  movement, too.  They could save far more lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion.  Hell, if they are only interested in fetuses, they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China.  And besides, Suzanne is answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet, I do not believe this to be the case.   mathew
