However, although baseball \thas adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic \tplayers still labor under the stereotype of being  fireballs, \thot blooded, flashy .  The report also emphasised that despite \tthe rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs \tdiscrimination against black players in its upper echelons, \tbaseball has actually done much better by black players than \tHispanic players.  \tAnother interesting point was the language barrier problem.  The \treporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he \tgave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with \tthe fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that \tspeak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not \tthe) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac \tMcCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his \tbook, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations \temploy Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being \tthe Oakland A is.  \tAnother point:  \tNearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood. \tYet, most report that they would never really felt black until \tplaying ball in the US.     \tIronically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American \tbaseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that \tbaseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson, \tas many  light black  or  brown , Latin Americans were \tincorporated into baseball.   \t/S --   I did not know the cure for the disease      -------------------   of images, but I believed in the healing     |  Sandra Vigil   |   power of words and stories.                  |  vigil@esca.com |                  - Until the End of the World     -------------------
