The earlier cars (pre  74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having  chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are  appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the  moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles. If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car  should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere.   The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes  that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting  the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.  *************************************************************************** *Rick Guynn -MG driver soontobe.  *  MGA 1600 MkII                        * *RCG1597@zeus.tamu.edu            *  Rebuild (complete) to be finished ?? * *Texas A&M University             *                                       * *Keeper of the eternal octagon    *  `69 MGB Roadster                     * * a.k.a.
