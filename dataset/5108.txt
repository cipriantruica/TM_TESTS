From: bshaw@spdc.ti.com (Bob Shaw) Subject: question on  xon  in X11R5   Hi folks  Say, i am new to R5 and have one quick question.  In using xon ( xon   )  , I notice that it always comes up with a very small window .  i am pretty sure its the default font.  My xterms all work normally. Is xon supposed to read your .Xresources for a font size ?  xrdb -q appears to show the right stuff.  I can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc and everything is correct.  Of course you could always do a  simple script to do this , but I have a feeling i am missing something simple here.  Comments / suggestions appreciated.  Thanks in advance  Bob bshaw@spdc.ti.com    mm
