He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.\'\' \tThe importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper is visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf. \tMack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.\'\' \t``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance,\'\' Mack told delegates.    Copyright 1993 by
