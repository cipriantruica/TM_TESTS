Hatred and bigotry >remain just that, no matter who practices them.  Indeed Yaqouv, just like the ugly hatred spread by Kahane and Kahanists, right?   Or they are exempt from condemnation, and allowed to hate?  No, fool, not at all like hatred of one is sworn enemies, enemies who have said time and again that they mean to kill you, and have, by mur- dering innocent men, women and children, shown that they really mean it.  The late rabbi never hated anyone merely for having been born into a par- ticular group, but he (and I) hate and would/will kill anyone who comes to kill Jews. I recall VERY well Rabbi Kahane is words to the Iraqis at a demonstration:  You want peace? Here is our hand (holding out an open hand)! You do not want peace? Here is our hand (holding out a fist)!   I know you shall answer me indirectly, it does not bother me a bit. Keep it up.  Indirectly? The wonder of it is that I bother answering the likes of you at ALL!
