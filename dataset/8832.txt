From: jja2h@Virginia.EDU (  ) Subject: Re: Brien Taylor: Where is he?  Last year Brein Taylor was in A ball, probably at Tampa in the Florida State League.  I believe he began this year in AA which is Albany.  Hopefully George will not rush him and he shall be allowed to progress at his own rate to AAA and then to the Bronx.  This guy is the real thing.
