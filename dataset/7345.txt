From: ae045@Freenet.carleton.ca (Mike Harker) Subject: Re: WHAT car is this!?   You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada. The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time, it stays in storage because the museum does not have much room. it is a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that is why they  have it.  If anybody is a fan, they also have a nice green \'73 Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom. --  MIKE HARKER OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA VOICE: 613-823-6757 --  Paul Tomblin (formerly pt@geovision.gvc.com) Sven is Law: there is exceptions to every law (except this one)
