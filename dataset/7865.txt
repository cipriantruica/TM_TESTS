My driveway and about half my neighbor is driveways are long enough to do a good 80 clicks (50mph for the velocity impaired) if we wanted to. Granted, I live in the country, however i have seen neighbors whip out of their driveways at the above mentioned 30 mph quite a bit- they claim they can tell that  there is noone on the road for quite a ways.  This despite having nearly been hit myself by one of them while driving a Chev 4x4, and twice taking my 10-speed bicycle over the hood of a car that had pulled out, saw me, *then* stopped.  Same driver.  Same car. About two months apart.    ObMoto:  The scary relevant part is that these people and I live on the type of twisty two lane that we all favor for riding- and I know damn well that they cannot see me on my bike, not if they could not see me in  my pickup.  > Ryan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride > KotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to > DoD  0863      |i had be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to > ryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . . >  >  >  * SLMR 2.1a *  he has hurt.
