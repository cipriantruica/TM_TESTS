From: loss@fs7.ECE.CMU.EDU (Doug Loss) Subject: Jemison on Star Trek     I saw in the newspaper last night that Dr. Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space (she is a physician and chemical engineer who flew on Endeavour last year) will appear as a transporter operator on the  Star Trek: The Next Generation  episode that airs the week of May 31. it is hardly space science, I know, but it is interesting.
