From: daniels@NeoSoft.com (Brad Daniels) Subject: Re: XV 3.00 has escaped!  Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice, I would say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course, this would be circumventing the author is wishes on the subject, but i had say if you are not going to pay him no matter what, you had be on relatively safe ground with that approach...  In fact, given the internal contradictions of the copyright notices, i had guess none of it could ever be enforced, but not being a lawyer, I cannot be positive.  Regardless, the fees he has asking are not excessive, and I would encourage anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the author, it would be reasonable to do so, to support his efforts if nothing else.  - Brad  --  Brad Daniels\t\t`\t|   If money cannot buy happiness, daniels@neosoft.com\t\t|   I guess i shall have to rent it.
