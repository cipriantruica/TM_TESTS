WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables & >all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order >directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and >they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty... >  Hmm, I do not know where this information concerning the cable and the warranty came from but I ordered mine from Logos Communications, near Cleveland, and inside was a Mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-)) and a lifetime warranty.  The whole package was assembled at AT&T Paradyne, and every piece (the serial cable, the telephone cable, etc.) had AT&T  part numbers on them, except the QuickLink software package and the  CompuServe intro kit.  >--  >Eric Behr, Illinois State University, Mathematics Department >behr@math.ilstu.edu   or   behr@ilstu.bitnet  (please avoid!)  If anyone is interested, Logos number is (800) 837-7777.  I ordered mine last Wednesday and got my modem on Friday, though it is not to far from Cleveland to Pittsburgh.. :-)  On the down side they only ship UPS COD.   \t\t\t\t\t- Chris  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |  Christopher P.
