It does not surprise me that as groups like  TRANSLATION- you minorities stay in predesignated areas.  We the majority are \'right\', anything you do is \'wrong\', since might makes right, and the majority always rules.  >Queer Nation become increasingly belligerent in their public  >demonstrations, that violence against homosexuals rises.

Well let us extrapolate this, maybe if  you did not display all of your private property, then those nasty theifs would not go after it.  And do not carry any money, that way those muggers will not bother you.  > >And you still do not realize that either way it is, says that homosexuals >are very dangerous to children. > >#  ># So tell me---what is immoral about homosexuality? > >The promiscuity and fetishism that characterizes it.

Oh I did not know that Le JoJo is a typical homosexual.  Stop making statements about something you know nothing about, that is gay people.  You make your sweeping generalizations with no grounding  in reality.   What I hope is not true- That you are a typical heterosexual.  Anyone want to comment on this?  And if you are typical then I can start extrapolating a lot of interesting conjectures about heterosexuals.  >--
