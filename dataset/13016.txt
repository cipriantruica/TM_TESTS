From: kjiv@lrc.edu Subject: Hismanal, et. al.--side effects  Can someone tell me whether or not any of the following medications  has been linked to rapid/excessive weight gain and/or a distorted  sense of taste or smell:  Hismanal; Azmacort (a topical steroid to  prevent asthma); Vancenase.  Also: You may have guessed, i am an allergy sufferer--but i am beginning to  suspect i am also the victim of a Dr. toliberal with the prescription  p. The allergist I went to last Oct. simply inquired about my symptons  ( I was suffering chronic asthma attacks), gave me a battery of  allergy tests, and went down a checklist of drugs (a photocopied  sheet).  i have gained out 30 lbs. since then though I have not eaten  more or much differently than before; I\'vsuffered depression; ,  fatigue; and i have experienced a foul smell and sense of taste for  about the last two months.  I mentioned the lack of smell and taste to  this Dr. in Feb. and he said my sinuses did look a bit swollen (he  just looked up my nose with his little light--the same one used for  ears), and prescribed Prednisone and Sulfatrim DS (severe headaches  and a rash resulted, particularly after my week is worth of Prednisone  ran out).  Now he wants to do a rhinoscopy to see if I have a bleeding  ulcer or polyps in my sinus cavities.  i am considering seeing another  doctor.  Any suggestions/advice?  i had really appreciate it!
