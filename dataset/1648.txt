From: deb47099@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Daniel E. Bradley) Subject: Help! Quicktime 1.5/System 7.1 Problem  \tI am unable to run Quicktime 1.5 on my IIvx running System 7.1, and \tI do not know why. (If there is a better group to post this to, please \tlet me know.) Quicktime 1.0 works fine, but when I try to run a movie \tin any application that supports it, Like Simple Player, Canvas or \tWord, I get the message  sorry a system error occurred \'\' \tunimplemented trap   , I press  and get \t The application \'unknown\' has unexpectedly quit, because an error of \ttype 12 occurred.  Substitute Simple Player or Canvas or Word for \t\', and the messages are always the same. If I restart with \tQuicktime 1.0, I have no problems. Any suggestions? I am at a loss. \t\tThanks in advance. Oh yah, please email me as I do not check \t\tthe newsgroups very often. \t\t\tDan Bradley deb47099@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu
