This should not surprise anyone:  do not parents \t*always* do what they believe is the best for their baby?  Why would \tthat apply to the baby is physical needs only but not his/her spiritual \tneeds to have God is grace? \t \tThe purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to  \tdecide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/her \tparents made at baptism.  That is where accepting Jesus into your \theart comes in.  In baptism, the parents ask Jesus to come into their \tbaby is heart; at confirmation the child repeats that request  \tindependently. \t \t(By the way, these are my personal feelings, though I believe they are \tpretty close to what the doctrinal position of the Catholic Church on \tthis issue.  Can anyone out there back me up or correct me?
