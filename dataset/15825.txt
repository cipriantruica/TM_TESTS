For pistols, nation-wide check for felonies and three days wait.  The  good reason  is the difference, and one Americans tend to get annoyed over as we see no reason the guy with the badge is any better than us.  >it is a little like getting a drivers licence is not it ??? >You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...  \tNot when dealing with America.  I can drive an 18-wheel truck with no permit, no license, and at age 12 if i am engaged in farming work.  Strange, that, but there is little to no problem with this. Again, personal rights versus collective security.  >Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners \'arms\' >for a long time, but these are rather the exeption. >Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short  >time befor the crime.  \tStrange that the rates would decline, since killing somebody is much more frowned upon than merely stealing a gun.  >Use of knives: >It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or \'open\'. >You (Americans) think it is ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open >in public -rigth ??  \tWhy attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from practice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attract a lot of attention doing this.  i had rather be lost  in a crowd of one  than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.  Think of the word  intimidation  and you can see where intimidation is not the preferable method for the normal citizen.  >Scandinavians ARE \'aggressive\': >We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide >to take action we DO. >Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe.... >(Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2.....)  \tAggressive towards whom?  Southerners?  Germans?  Precisely why I think your society is less violent, weapons aside.  >Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some >extent.... >Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ?? >What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of  >all the [masses?? -- editor barf -- Dan]  \tThen the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we would likely tell the EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note that our own state governments often play with game with the federal government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.  >IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME. >But should it have to be like that ??  \tIt should not.  Since neither of our countries has managed to remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals in our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.  >Do you think it is wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ?? >If you believe it is smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think >it should be free to buy guns ??  \tWe do not.  E-mail me to find out just how difficult it really is in this country.  It is easier than in yours, but theft is far easier than the troubles we go through to purchase over here.  >I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I do not view guns as >neccities or toys.  \tThey are neither.  They are an option.  We would never force you to own guns if you lived here.  We would, however, fight to keep that option open to you.  >I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but would not >want to have one for self defence or because they \'feel good\'....  \tThen you show you are a responsible, rational user of weapons. Welcome to our ranks.  Now, how do we teach the young people this sort of responsibility?  Cultures seem to have a grave impact here.  \tI notice you did not use my great-grandfather is name.  Well, he did not like it much either ;-)
