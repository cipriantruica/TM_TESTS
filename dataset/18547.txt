Of course it is.  It forms a very big part of your self-respect.  You come onto  the board, thinking you are some sort of apologeticist for your faith, and you routinely get roasted over a grill for stupid theories and unfounded assumptions.     /(Frank DeCenso) /This board will have />to wait until (if ever) I can organize my life to fit it in.  I tried dropping />out, but Sieferman coerced me to come back.  He will not this time.  I doubt that Sieferman has anything to do with you dropping out.    it is probably closer to the truth to say that you do not have the cards to  play in this game (because you insist on playing from a losing hand), and you are finally realizing it.  You will lurk on the board, and keep  quiet for a while, looking for an area where you are *certain* that you  are correct, and then we will see you pop back in again.  Of course, you then will say that you have merely returned because your life is now  in order .  But we will know better.
