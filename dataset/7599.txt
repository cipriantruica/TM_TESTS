From: asdch@acad2.alaska.edu Subject: Re: Last of the V-8 Interceptors (Mad Max)  \tTony,  I believe, first of all, that Max is car is an Austrailian built car.  I do not think its a chopped up U.S. unit.  It may be called a Kangaroo or Roo or something similar-not sure.  But, I do recall reading that Austrailian cars used Ford V-8 engines.  The Ford V-8 Interceptor is, I think, a 428 c.i. cop car motor.  Whatever the case that small car with a screaming big block Ford 428 would probably smoke the tires for miles/kilometers.  I hope someone out there can elaborate on the subject. \t\t \t\t\tSmoke \'em hard, smoke \'em fast.  Later, \t\t\t\t\tDavid Hertrich. \t\t\t\t\'68 Lincoln Continental 460c.i.
