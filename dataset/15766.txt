Maybe they are just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston, chances are almost certain that she will not be counted  as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary did not consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the  gun owner  column.  >       In either case, this means the \'average > \tthreat level\' in this country is rather low.   Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The  average threat level  in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  it is well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because  they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the   average threat level in the country  means to a resident there.  > \tI think you have weapons on the brain.

Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors  on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  i have misplaced the original text, but the story started with one resident calling the  cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a  drive-by performed at the resident is house.  Except that this time, unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting an end to the car is occupants.  The gang packed up and left.  Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane, your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell anything.  > \tIn short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at > \tleast a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative. > \tReplace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better > \tconversationalist too and you can invite it over for a > \tblock party.   Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.   That does not mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches  on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if -- DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it is too late for any of these things EXCEPT the extinguisher.  > >        But legality and legitimacy also matter.

You cannot trust your government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar, blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the power to enforce your  rights  but you.  Unless you have given up that  power.  > \tNo. I claimed that no one is interested in the statistical > \taspects of the argument. Pure emotion, like the abortion issue.  Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun  ownership because they have been conditioned to believe that there AREN\'T  any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; i am willing to try to raise their consciousness.  > \tArgue away ... you cannot win.   I think we can.  HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80 is, they ran a  One  Million Strong!  campaign for two years before reaching this goal.   My understanding is that they  reached  it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I cannot speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a  Two Million Strong!  campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership.  In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.   By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had  about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla is  Gun Control,  pp. 61 and 420.)  As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against  hard-core gun banners.  I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members. i have never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.  Yes, I think we can and will win this one.  > \tFirearms-related mindless mayhem will be related to the > \tavailibility of firearms.

I think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but, like you, I cannot give any citation showing that this utilization is CURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal level.  If you can,  i am waiting. --   cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\' Packet...
