Please reply via e-mail.  They are not functions, they are character arrays. The standard strings are either defined as string constants or character pointers into XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it undefined so simply recompile one or the other. It is probably worth adding -DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS.  --   Michael Salmon   \t  \t  \t  Ericsson Telecom AB Stockholm
