It is not enough (around a thousand) for the average non-crook, non-spy to worry about. In fact, considering any reasonable guess about the number of big-time crooks and spies around, it may not be enough even for most crooks and spies to worry about.  there is no reason to believe that it will go up with Clipper, since the number of taps now includes many targets too stupid to use encryption (based on the playbacks we have heard in court cases).
