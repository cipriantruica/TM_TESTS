The test is not whether GM knew--otherwise that would reward GM for its stupidity.  The test is whether GM reasonably should have known of their existence.  It works both ways--if GM had won the trial, and the plaintiff turned up two witnesses who came forward after the first trial who should have been located beforehand, too bad, so sad--no new trial.  Like Tim said, you do not get a new civil trial because you screwed up  the first time around.  Unlike the criminal justice system, repose is much more important in the civil justice system. --  ted frank                 |  thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |         i am sorry, the card says  Moops.  the u of c law school     |  standard disclaimers      |
