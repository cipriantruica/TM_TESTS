What? No holograms? Get outta >here!   I can wait \'cos i have already got an accelerated card. It does 1280x1024 but only 16 colour. You may mock me, but such cards will be here quickly enough.  >One of the odd things about the computer industry is that, since you can >always wait and get something better, some people wait forever.

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff is big enough to warrant changing. For instance, i shall be upgrading my 486 33 to a 486DX-2 66 EISA, VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux) is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time i shall be buying a new graphic card and new SCSI controller. i shall be buying an S3 card \'cos they are fast enough, I have X11 drivers for them and it shall have 2MB VRAM just like a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards arrive, i shall buy one.  >Personally, my system at home needs a new disk subsystem, a much >larger monitor, a super-fast graphics board by you-know-who, a new >CPU board -- I probably will not keep much more than the case and the >mouse.  Come to think of it, I do not like that mouse very much.  So >when will I buy?  When my dream products hit the market? NO WAY!  i am >gonna buy as soon as I have the MONEY!  Over the last year i have done much the same. But now I need a 19  monitor, more memory (20MB just am not enough), a GB disk (1.2GB and no space left...). Oh well, stay single, do not smoke and you may afford it this year ;-)  --  Wayne Hodgen  | hodgen@infko.uni-koblenz.de | Opinions (c) Me 1991   | Intel SX Uni Koblenz,  | (..!unido!infko!hodgen)     | Keeper of the Scrolls, |  Just Rheinau 3-4,  | Voice: +49 261 9119-645     | Defender of the Net,   |   say 5400 Koblenz. | Fax:   +49 261 9119-499     | His name is  root .    |    NO!!!
