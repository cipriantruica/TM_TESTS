Big deal.  Are you for real?  How many Gold Gloves does Ozzie Smith have?  If a guy hung around and hit 30 homers a year for 15 years, would not he be a given for the Hall?  Is defense not just as important?  And if Robin Yount could not hit, why would he have stuck around long enough to get 3,000 hits?  Are you saying 3,000 hits is a fluke?  3,000 hits is no big deal?    >     let us be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors >so > >liberally.

Gee, can these guys even compare to I agree, Garvey and Morris do not deserve it.   >the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?  Well, based on your argument, Nolan Ryan does not deserve the Hall of Fame.  He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time and could throw hard.  Very few 20 game winning seasons, lots of losing seasons, lots of walks.  No Cy Young awards.  How does Nolan Ryan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated 5 or 6 Major League seasons, won 7 divisons, 2 World Series, and won half of his teams games in 1972?  He does not compare.  Not even close.  Kirby Puckett has not done it long enough for me.  Give me 5 more seasons like he has been having, then i shall think about it.
