Any replies encouraged.  Thanks in ad- > vance.  You may have been emailed this, but the IIsi is power supply is not rated to handle the GC board.  Remember when the si came out and everyone complained about it is power supply.  This is one result of apple providing a low-cost computer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end computer (at the time anyways) that could not even support their own video board.  Even if this is not what is causing your problems, you might develop one later.  Eric
