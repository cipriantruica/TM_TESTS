From: davidb@macadam.mpce.mq.edu.au (David Bull) Subject: Intel RMX O/S Documentation Wanted   we have just been donated a large machine for use in our robotics lab. This device is complete with a 286 based controller, running the Intel RMX operating system.  Unfortunately, we do not have any documentation on RMX.  Can anybody out there in netland help?  Please reply via email; I do not regularly catch up with the news.  Thanks,  David Bull  davidb@mpce.mq.edu.au
