No.  The blue LEDs sold down the street are in milky-white plastic.    And, fyi, putting a filter on a  typical visible light LED  (presumably meaning a non-blue one) will not produce blue light.  A filter can only block light, it cannot generate wavelengths that are not there to start with.    \t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA Internet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055
