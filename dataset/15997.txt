Again, my response is,  so what?   Is Mr. Rutledge arguing that since  the local and federal governments have abandoned their charter to support  such activity, and passed laws prohibiting private organizations from   doing so, that they have eliminated the basis for the RKBA?   On the  contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it.  Mox nix, Mr. Rutledge.  YOU are the only one here claiming that the  RKBA is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated  militia.  Why this is a false assumption has already been posted a   number of times.   < <No, I simple stated that the people have a right to  join a well <organized militia.   And I have also stated that a militia that <meets once or twice a year is clearly  well organized.

You better read the Senate Subcommitte on the Constitution regarding the Second Amendment, and a linguist is analisys of the Second itself. IN the meanwhile, show us some stuff to back up your assertions. And yes, I have the above mentioned documents (and more) online.  --  pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA          If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat WISDOM:  Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,          and I am not sure about the former.               - Albert Einstien
