For most people, this does not occur.  On the other hand, most people can build up a tolerance to an antihistamine with extended use. (Allergy sufferers are often switched from one antihistamine to another to avoid this.)   -- Steven Litvintchouk MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road Bedford, MA  01730-1420  Fone:  (617)271-7753 ARPA:  sdl@mitre.org UUCP:  linus!sdl
