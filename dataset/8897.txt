Do you suppose he has immune to the ravages of time?  he has 37.   In a few years he shall be 40.  He does not get to as many grounders as he used to, and will get to fewer still as his legs go, as they do on every human so far.  Remember: Willie Mays was a defensive liability at he end of his career too.  Ditto Mickey Mantle.  Ditto just about everyone else who  played into their late 30 is.
