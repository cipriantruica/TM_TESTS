Subject: Mark Whiten From: rsmith@strobe.ATC.Olivetti.Com (Russ Smith)  I was on vacation all last week and did not see any news at all. Could somebody fill me in on how St. Louis ended up with Mark Whiten in a  trade? Who did we give up Arocha, Allen Watson, Dmitri Young, or did Dal make a decent deal?  :   Russ Smith *******************************************************************************  I do not know anything about X is, but I know about some O.
