From: walker@thufir.cs.umn.edu (Robert Paul Walker) Subject: DOS Board with 16 ports.  i am posting this for a friend that runs a BBS. i am not sure if its under DOS or Windows.  He is interested in a board that has 16 ports on it. In another post, someone suggeted a DigiBoard, but did not have too much info on it.  Could someone give me information on any boards that they know of with the before mentioned configuration. Models. Specifications. Prices.  Manufacturers.  Thanks,  Rob  --  Robert Walker                     walker@cs.umn.edu Computer Science Dept. University of Minnesota
