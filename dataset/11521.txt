[...]     I heard somewhere (cannot name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily    pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If    that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything    on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify    or refute this?  Yes, that is true.  TEMPEST is nothing magic, it is just listening to any available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques   you know to separate out the interesting stuff.   The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of signal, so they are easy to detect, and if you do your sync carefully, you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked Chevy Step-Van.  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse. In both cases, it is especially nice because it gets you the data the user is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is paging out to disk, etc.  With newer, quieter equipment, there is not as much signal, and it is harder to isolate the fun parts.  TEMPEST-rated equipment has much lower signal levels. But  Everything has vibrations , as Master Chuan said. --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
