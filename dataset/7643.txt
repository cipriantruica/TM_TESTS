It will help somewhat but nothing  will remove deep scratches without making it worse than it already is. McQuires will do something for fine or light stuff.  Also suggest calling your local plastic shop.  In Calif.  TAP PLASTIC  is a chain that carries most of what is needed for repair and sometimes replacement of plastic bits.  Telephone in the Bay area is 415-962-8430. i am not sure how amenable they are to shipping.  I have found that they have several excellent products for cleaning, and removing crap from windscreens and face shields.  Also they have one called  lift-it  which works real well in removing sticky stuffs such as adhessives from plastic wihtout scratching same.  Luck,  Jonathan Jefferies, jeff@mri.com
