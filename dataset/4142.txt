From: kuan@netcom.com (Kuan) Subject: Video Display      My mac monitor displays about 20 vertical lines when I use it. It means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad or video card is bad.    I checked my monitor, it works fine with other Mac.    I checked my video card, it is also fine.    I replaced all the RAMs, it still did not give me right answer.    Hence I assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard.     I do not know hardware architecture of the Macintosh.     Can anyone tell me what is the problem ????     it is a Mac IIcx.
