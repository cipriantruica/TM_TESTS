The original RISCs had small instruction sets, and simple ones. The idea was that a) every instruction should be completable in a single clock cycle and b) to have no microcode and c) extensive pipelines.  A few comparisons (from Patterson: Reduced Instruction set computers. CACM V28. 1, 1985):  CPU\t\tYear\tInstructions\tMicrocode ---\t\t----\t------------\t--------- IBM 370/168\t1973\t208\t\t420Kb DEC VAX 11/780\t1978\t303\t\t480Kb IBM 801\t\t1980\t120\t\t0 UCB RISC 1\t1982\t39\t\t0 Stanford MIPS\t1983\t55\t\t0  While researching for the VLSI VAX, DEC discovered that 60% of the VAX microcode is there to support 20% of the instruction set which accounted for a mere 0.2% of all instructions executed. The uVAX 32 subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software emulator for these very complex instructions, the full VLSI uVAX included the entire instruction set, was 5-10 times more copmlex but only ranm 20% faster.
