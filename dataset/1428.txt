From: s127@ii.uib.no (Torgeir Veimo) Subject: C++ classes for graphics  i am planning on writing several classes to build a raytracing/radiosity library on top of, and i am wondering if anythink like this is freely available on the net before i go to it. What i need is classes like rays, vectors, colors, shaders, surfaces, media, primitives, worlds (containing primitives) and views/images.  Please post or mail. --  Torgeir Veimo  Studying at the University of Bergen   ...i am gona wave my freak flag high!  (Jimi Hendrix)   ...and it would be okay on any other day!  (The Police)
