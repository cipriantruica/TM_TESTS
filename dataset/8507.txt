Another newbie bites the dust, eh?  they will learn. %    Newbie?  Eh?  Slap yer\' credentials  on the table, Pete.  That\'ll  show    him!  % % i am terribly sorry. %    And so you damned well should  be...  young whipper-snapper!  it is  wet    kippers at ten paces if there is any repeat of this sort of thing!     Now, in keeping with the  grand tradition of wreck.moto, let us  mutate!    Take your partners by the hand...     On Tuesday morning I spent a couple of hours (when I -should- have been    working) with a  torch, brazing bits  of scrap metal  over the  biggest    holes in  Yamadog is exhaust  pipes (s\'mazin\'  what you  can do  with  a    couple of AA  cells and a  three-volt bulb!).   I stuck some   gun-gum     into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike.     So, last night  i am on the  way home  when lo\' an\'  bloody behold,  the    sodding thing starts  blowing again.   I check  it out and  the gas  is    escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the    port.  As far as I can see (it being somewhat  hole of Calcutta  at the    time!), the nuts are still there  (stop that bloody sniggering, you  at    the back!), but the pipe is a bit loose.     This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socket-set  to    tighten up me\' nuts (somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good    slap  round  the  back  of  the  head!),  and  lo\'  an\'  bloody  behold    a-bloody-gen, I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from    the inner sleeve right at the clamp-mating bevel.  So, I stuff in a bit    of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts\' very best  gun-gum   and    come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a    brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?  Anybody tried it?     Oh, and if anybody can tell me  what the differences are between a  205    and a  207  brazing  rod (made  by   Gaz   [Yup!   the  camping  folks.    Surprised the marmalade outa\' me, too!] in that place just off the Isle    of Wight) i had be eternally  grateful (twenty-sodding-quid for two  rods    and I do not even know what i am buying.  Bloody kanji!).  --     ------------------------------------------------------------------------   | John Little  - gaijin@Japan.Sun.COM  - Sun Microsystems.
