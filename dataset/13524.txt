Recently, I completed a 2 week juice fast (with 3 days of water) and had two colonics as part of it.  My motivation was primarily spiritual, to de-toxify from all the crap i have been putting in my body (not like thats enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect).  Personaly, I did not find it an uncomfortable experience (the colonic), lost about 15lbs of beer belly (which has not come back over the last month), and feel great.  One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was seeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from years of indulgence.  Not everything that goes in comes out, and personaly I do not mind giving my body a hand once in a while.  Just my experience,  George Paap  I am my beliefs. (which almost certainly are not those of my employer)
