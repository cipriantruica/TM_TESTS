Additions would be     appreciated.      Numbers in parentheses are approximations that will serve for most     blue-skying purposes.      Unix systems provide the \'units\' program, useful in converting     between different systems (metric/English, etc.)      NUMBERS  \t7726 m/s\t (8000)  -- Earth orbital velocity at 300 km altitude \t3075 m/s\t (3000)  -- Earth orbital velocity at 35786 km (geosync) \t6371 km\t\t (6400)  -- Mean radius of Earth \t6378 km\t\t (6400)  -- Equatorial radius of Earth \t1738 km\t\t (1700)  -- Mean radius of Moon \t5.974e24 kg\t (6e24)  -- Mass of Earth \t7.348e22 kg\t (7e22)  -- Mass of Moon \t1.989e30 kg\t (2e30)  -- Mass of Sun \t3.986e14 m^3/s^2 (4e14)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Earth \t4.903e12 m^3/s^2 (5e12)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Moon \t1.327e20 m^3/s^2 (13e19) -- Gravitational constant times mass of Sun \t384401 km\t ( 4e5)  -- Mean Earth-Moon distance \t1.496e11 m\t (15e10) -- Mean Earth-Sun distance (Astronomical Unit)  \t1 megaton (MT) TNT = about 4.2e15 J or the energy equivalent of \tabout .05 kg (50 gm) of matter.
