Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn is atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn is     satellites, and characterize Titan is atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan is clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn is satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn is rings.  \t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory) \t ------------------------------------------------------------- \t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch \t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist \t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist \t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist \t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist \t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival \t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release \t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry \t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission \t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)       GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned     the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to     Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have     essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data     compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from     the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve     approximately 70% of its original objectives.  \t   Galileo Schedule \t   ---------------- \t   10/18/89 - Launch from Space Shuttle \t   02/09/90 - Venus Flyby \t   10/**/90 - Venus Data Playback \t   12/08/90 - 1st Earth Flyby \t   05/01/91 - High Gain Antenna Unfurled \t   07/91 - 06/92 - 1st Asteroid Belt Passage \t   10/29/91 - Asteroid Gaspra Flyby \t   12/08/92 - 2nd Earth Flyby \t   05/93 - 11/93 - 2nd Asteroid Belt Passage \t   08/28/93 - Asteroid Ida Flyby \t   07/02/95 - Probe Separation \t   07/09/95 - Orbiter Deflection Maneuver \t   12/95 - 10/97 - Orbital Tour of Jovian Moons \t   12/07/95 - Jupiter/Io Encounter \t   07/18/96 - Ganymede \t   09/28/96 - Ganymede \t   12/12/96 - Callisto \t   01/23/97 - Europa \t   02/28/97 - Ganymede \t   04/22/97 - Europa \t   05/31/97 - Europa \t   10/05/97 - Jupiter Magnetotail Exploration       HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. Has made     multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,     into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon.       MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter is north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun is south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that is right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that is always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter is neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical     detail, see the many articles in the same issue.
