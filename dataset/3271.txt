From: andrew@frip.WV.TEK.COM (Andrew Klossner) Subject: Re: Soundblaster IRQ and Port settings  []  \t These LPT1, COM1, disk controller are call devices.  There are \tdevices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership, eg. disk \tcontroller (I6) and keyboard (I1).  There are also devices that \tdoes not require exclusive ownership, ie. it will share an \tinterrupt with another device, eg. LPT1   No.  In a standard ISA bus, the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use, two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to a screwup in the bus design.  For example, if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt. This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.  When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it is because they are implemented by a single card.    -=- Andrew Klossner  (andrew@frip.wv.tek.com)
