This is one of those  yes, but  things. it is true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube, but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily, though it is straight-on compressive strength is high, and it is torsional  resistance increase is practically nil. On the other grasping member,  there is no doubt that hydraulic  leverage  exists in nature. Tree roots  are an example.

Kangaroos 3-limbed? I do not think so. If you take the view that the tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion. I do not know much about panda  thumbs , so i shall ask is it opposable?  >>Thermodynamic considerations of surface/volume relationships would >>seem to dictate that active complex creatures  stay in a size range >>similar to what we see about us. 6 inch tall intelligent aliens >>seem unlikely, as do those much larger than the elephant. > >Why cannot a lemur or a brontosaurus* be intelligent? > >[*Yes, I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by >putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus, but so far >space aliens are also mythical.]  Well I will not say flat out that they cannot be intelligent, but i shall bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I do not think it is likely. First let me say that when I say  intelligent  I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter  it is enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. that is certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice for a putative technological alien.  Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but it is generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur would not have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. there is room for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages  that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures. So there is little selection pressure for such brains. Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This does not rule out intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.  Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it is internal heat is rapidly lost due to it is high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature that must spend most of it is time and energy feeding will not have the time to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak. The dinosaur is problem is the reverse, it must moderate it is heat production  because it is high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat.  i am assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature the size of a brontosaur, it is activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity.
