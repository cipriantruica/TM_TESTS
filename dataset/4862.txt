From: atae@spva.ph.ic.ac.uk (Ata Etemadi) Subject: Ideal Operating System (Was: DEATH BLOW TO UNIX)  G\'Day  Windows NT is a step forward, but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:  \tBinary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize \tbinaries and configure on the fly, so I do not have to have \tbin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...  \tMulti-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac  \tand Transputers and DSPs. I do not know a single site which  \thas gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in  \t80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. \tNote NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.  \tBuilt-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton  \tor DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform  \tor display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. \tso I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on   \tmy PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.  \tConfigurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS \tor NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.  \tObject oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have \tto re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch \tor my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.  In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it. Anyone know of something like this ?  \tadios \t     Ata . --  | Mail          Dr Ata Etemadi, Blackett Laboratory,                          | |               Space and Atmospheric Physics Group,                          | |               Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine,        | | Internet/Arpanet/Earn/Bitnet atae@spva.ph.ic.ac.uk or ata@c.mssl.ucl.ac.uk  | | Span                              SPVA::atae       or     MSSLC:atae        |
