Concepts like >santification and Lev. 17:11 must be foreign to you.  Too bad >you are not interested in understanding.  Too bad you prefer >blurting folly even to your own shame.    Lev 17:11: For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given   it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is   the blood that makes atonement for the soul.  The Old Testament was very big on the  eye for an eye  business.  It makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to  repay  moral wrongdoing.  I know about sanctification.  i have been taught all about it in Sunday school, catechism class, and theology classes.  But even after all that, I still cannot accept it.  Maybe i am still not understanding it, or maybe i am just understanding it all too well.  From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent man is wrong.  i have tried repeatedly over the course of several years to accept it, but I just cannot.  If this means that I cannot accept the premise that a god who would allow this is \'perfectly good\', then so be it.  >     What ignorance you can show us next?  I guess i shall wait >till tomorrow.  If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a *good* thing, then I would be very glad to hear it, and you might even convert me. Be warned, however, that i have heard all the most common arguments before, and they just do not convince me.  --  _/_/_/  Brian Kendig                             Je ne suis fait comme aucun /_/_/  bskendig@netcom.com                de ceux que j\'ai vus; j\'ose croire _/_/                            n\'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent.   /  The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre.  /    is that it ends.                                           -- Rousseau
