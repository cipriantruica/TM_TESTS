They brought him in for a \tphysical/tryout a week or so ago. From what I have read \tNiedermayer is the best skater in the draft, plays BOTH \toffense and defense, and is not afraid of physical play. \tDefensively the Sharks are looking pretty good in terms of \tdefense prospects (Rathje, Sykora, Ragnarsson), and our \tcenters (Kisio et al) are getting old.  \tWith all of the small players the Sharks have I justs CAN\'t \tsee them picking yet another small player like Kariya, he had \tjust get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated  \tshoulder.  \tmark
