This claim is completely unverifiable and untestable.  i had wager most of the Braves fans on the net could name more than 3 players from their 1988 season.  You could give away tickets to Braves games.  However, my Dad and I were able to get great seats from scalper for face value, which is not exactly the sign of a hot ticket...  >\tGranted, the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park, but >that does not mean they diserve the title  America is Team  >\tThe only reason they are considered America is team is because of Ted >Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation.  This is *precisely* why they were considered America is team.  Even (especially?) when they were bad, you could see most of the Braves games on cable.  You could do that for the Cubs as well, but the Braves had better camerawork, better announcers (what would you rather listen to -- Harry discuss the game, or Skip and Pete discuss motoball?), and teams that were not *too* much worse.  Because of TBS, the Braves had a lot of fans outside of Georgia. At home in Kentucky, even though we were much closer to Cincinnati there was as many Braves fans as Reds fans, even in 1990.  You could actually watch the Braves play -- you had to go to Cincinnati to watch the Reds.  I can go anywhere in America and watch the Braves.      >\ti shall consider Toronto AMerica is team before the Braves  Why?  i had guess that Braves fans are more widely distributed than Toronto fans. --  Dale J.
