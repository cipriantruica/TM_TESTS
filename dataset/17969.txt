First of all, I would not have gone after the Davidians for a firearms violation which I object to in the first place.  Second, I would not have executed a search warrant via an armed assault when all the Davidians were sure to have been there.  Third of all, I would not have cut off all outside communication to Koresh.  And I certainly would not have gone in with a tank-- time was on the FBIs side.
