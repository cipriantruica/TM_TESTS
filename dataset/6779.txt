Btw, I subscribe to three other  auto rags, I just think CU is getting a bum rap by these macho men from hell who think real men should read . . . .  Statements like what you said above have no meaning. People keep on saying  CU is only good for dishwashing detergent  or as you said: Relying on Consumer Reports . . . . is like. . .   and that is all they say.   If there were as critical of themsevles as they are of CU maybe there would be some real content.  john    --  John Nielsen   MAGNUS Consultant            ______   ______   __  __\t  To you Baldrick, the Renaissance was just /   __   /   ___  /   /    something that happened to other people,        /      ___        _    was not it?  - The Black Adder                  _____  / _____    _____
