The majority   of people I heard emitting this ignorant statement, do not really   know what zionism is. They have just associated it with what they think   they know about the political situation in the middle east.       So Steve: Lets here, what IS zionism?    Assuming that you mean \'hear\', you were not \'listening\': he just   told you,  Zionism is Racism.   This is a tautological statement.  --- D. C.
