From: demon@desire.wright.edu (Not a Boomer) Subject: The state of justice  \tA judge denied GM is new trial motion, even though GM says it has two new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact, not from the fire.  \tThoughts?  \tit is kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led to the previous ruling appear.  \tOr has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed?  should not that be up to a jury?  \tAnd what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM?  should not that be enough for a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial?  \tWhatever happened to jurors having to be objective?
