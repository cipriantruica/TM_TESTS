From: scottj@magic.dml.georgetown.edu (John L. Scott) Subject: Apology (was: Luser!)  I was shocked to see that the subject of my last rely to awesley was  Luser!   That was certainly not my intention.  I meant to leave the subject line unchanged.  I believe that the NNTP server I use at columbia must have put in that subject line in protest over problems with my header.  That was rather rude of them, but beggars cannot be choosers, I suppose.  In any case, I did not do it and I apologize to awesley for the apparent insult.  --John L. Scott
