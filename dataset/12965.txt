I do not mean to be disrespectful to your concerns, but it seems to me  that you are getting all wound up in a non-issue.    As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it is a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife is theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.  But I do not believe it is ALWAYS the reason it is  added.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their  own appetites.   >children is and my parent is) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet >food.

I also suspect, though it is been a while since i have checked ingredients  on commercial cat food, that there are much more stringent requirements  on pet food additives than human.    See, the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence  to look out after their own interests.    Barbara, wondering how her cat would take care of *her*
