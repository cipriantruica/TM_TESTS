Suicide is considered a sin by Branch Davidians.  Also, Koresh said over and over again that he was not going to commit suicide.  Furthermore, all the cult experts said that he was not suicidal.  David Thibedeau (sp?), one of the cult members, said that the fire was started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the facilities knocked over a lantern.   > The evil was inside the compound.    Evidence please?  > All that  thou shalt not kill  stuff.  i had like to point out that the Bible says  Do not commit murder.  The NKJ translation mistranslates.  Self-defense was never considered murder.  The reason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid the government would try something.  Their fears were obviously well founded. --Ray Cote  there is no government like no government.
