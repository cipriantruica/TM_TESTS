The V6 and AT are remarkably smooth.                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Agreed!  I own a Mercury Villager and i am very impressed with the V6 and the AT.  In the past, i have been biased towards manual/standard transmissions(I owned an Aerostar with a 5-speed, it was awesome!), but settled with the AT in the Villager and have been pleasantly surprised with it is performance.   BTW, Consumers Report in their report on the Villager, alluded to some funny noises from the AT, i have been listening for them but have not noticed anything unusual.   -Chris   Christopher J.
