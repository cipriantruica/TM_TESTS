I lived in Moscow for 21 years, and if I am 5 minutes walk to Belorusskaya subway station, I CANNOT be walking distance to Kremlin. Unless 1 hour of walking is what you mean. By the way, what is the price? I may plan a trip there (not sure yet, though) in late summer.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tVick \t\t\t\t\t(victorf@seas.ucla.edu) \t
