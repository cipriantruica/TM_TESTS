From: ritley@uimrl7.mrl.uiuc.edu () Subject: MYSTERY ILLNESS WITH SPOTS    I attended high school in the San Jose, California area in the early 1980 is, and I remember a (smallish) outbreak of a strange illness, in which people developed measles-like spots on their bodies.  This condition seemed to last only a few days, and I do not recall anyone reporting any other symptoms.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that this was believed to have been viral in nature, but I do not know for sure.  However, I have been curious since then about this.  Anyone have any ideas about what this might have been?
