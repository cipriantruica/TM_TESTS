She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte\tpredicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who \twas not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)  \tShe warned there would be  fire in the sky  as a warning that the  \tsecond world war was about to start.  About a week before Germany \tinvaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from \tEngland to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular \treddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to  \texplain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary is \tprediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.  \tMary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all \tover the world and persecute religion.    \tShe said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every \tsingle one has been realized.  \tOne can only use the term  coincidence  \tso many times in the same explanation before its use becomes  \tridiculous.    \tSO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports. There \tare true ones, too.  We must always remain open to that.  Fatima was \tone example.  There is another one, currently occuring--the  \tapparitions that have been taking place at Medjurgorje, Yugoslavia \t(or whatever its called now).  Mary has been appearing every day for \televen years now.  it is time the world started listening.  \tMore info available to any who want it. \t\t\t\t\t\tPeace in Christ Our Lord, \t\t\t\t\t\t- Mike Walker \t\t\t\t\t\t  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu
