It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it is been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.  > However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a > BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual.  >   attr.colormap = cmap; >   win = XCreateWindow( [...] >           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */ >           8,                    /* depth */ >           InputOutput,          /* class */ >           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */ >           CWColormap, >           &attr >         );  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window is depth does not match its parent is.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I cannot find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, i am not entirely certain it is possible for Xlib to catch this.)  \t\t\t\t\tder Mouse  \t\t\t\tmouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu
