From: krouth@slee01.srl.ford.com (Kevin Routh) Subject: F.Y.I.: ImageWriter to Windows...  [ Article crossposted from comp.windows.ms ] [ Author was Kevin Routh ] [ Posted on 19 Apr 1993 12:35:55 GMT ]  For your information:  I hooked up my ImageWriter I to my COM1 serial port and used the C-Itoh 8510 driver in Windows 3.1.  The cable I am using is a straight-thru cable connected to a Null Modem Adapter I got at Radio Shack (catalog   for $4.95.  It seems to work fine with both DOS and Windows. I used the following command in DOS  \tC: DOS mode COM1:9600,n,8,1,p  and set up the port the same way in the Windows Ports setup.  the Null Modem connections are as follows:  \t1\tto\t1 \t2\tto\t3 \t3\tto\t2 \t4\tto\t5 \t5\tto\t4 \t6+8\tto\t20 \t20\tto\t6+8 \t7\tto\t7  I printed from several applications and all seems OK.    --  Kevin C.
