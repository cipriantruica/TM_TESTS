From: bill@occs.cs.oberlin.edu (Bill Mohler) Subject: Need Hydrophone Info.   I do not know much about Hydrophones, so i am looking for any information that will help avoid problems I have not thought of! I would like an  inexpensive hydrophone and amplifier with tape (line level) outputs... something like Edmund sells for $250. They also sell just the microphone (hydrophone) head for $24, but how does one construct the enclosure? Any information would be greatly appreciated, Thanks!  Bill Mohler bill@occs.cs.oberlin.edu
