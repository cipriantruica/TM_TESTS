(If you think this is >confusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and >Methodists from an atheist point of view :).  i am a little confused about the difference between this  weak atheism , as you put it, and agnosticism.  is agnosticism not believing or necessarily disbelieving in anything, or what is it?  i used to be agnostic (by this definition) -- but if weak atheism includes not necessarily believing in God, then i guess i was one of those.  ???  actually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not ever decide what they believe.  i am constantly in a state of self-examination, as it would appear many others are as well (including the atheists, of course -- i had assume that is why they are here!).  i guess some people do not really consider it important to think about the answers to  life, the universe and everything  -- any comment?  just wondering....  >This is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in >something (followed up by  everyone has faith in something ). Guess what? >My atheism ends the moment i am shown a proof of some god is existence. Is >that really too much to ask?  tough call, as these things seem to be based on faith -- wish i could help you, but i already tried once with someone who was a self-professed agnostic-thinking-of-becoming-a -christian, and it did not work too well!  especially tough as i am still mulling over whether or not i believe in miracles (looks like another email to my chaplain is coming up....).  all i can do is wish you the best of luck, and please do post what you find.  >And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that >I can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.  hmm, how so?  i guess i really do not understand.  there are times, of course, when i say to myself  of course i have absolutely no way of knowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and sense of peace i get from it -- which of course could just be psychological .  somehow i live with this anyway -- is this what you mean?  the only  proof  i have is that i believe God spoke to me once -- which could of course be my own imagination.  the odd thing is, though, that if you do not at some point start believing in something, after a while it all gets sort of ridiculous.  maybe it is just a question of where you draw the line.  >I have been unable to reconcile it so far.

Logical or >physical proofs only, please. Then we will discuss the nature of  God .  i shall only add one question -- have you read pascal?  what did you think of him if you did?  also you may (or may not) be interested by cslewis/ _surprised by joy_.  i had be interested in knowing what you think of him, no sarcasm at all intended.  (i just say this because one can never know how one is written words will be interpreted.  i am not interested in converting you, since i do not seem to have whatever it would take -- proof -- to do so.  i am just interested in learning.)  >Muppets and garlic toast forever,  i like this.  >Max (Bob) Muir  cheers, vera ________ i give you everything\t\tdisclaimer: of course i do not agree with my sweet everything\t\ttrent reznor is (nin is) theology.  i think     - nine inch nails\t\tit is interesting nonetheless. noye@midway.uchicago.edu \t(vera noyes)
