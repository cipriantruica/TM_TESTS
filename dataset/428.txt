Again, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there was only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably did not say all that many things, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have arisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of  personal interpretation .  > A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind, > whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present > in any religion.  This is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a system of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least not without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to the point of  testing hypotheses  against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all the tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.  >  > I claimed that a ``Christian philosopher\'\' is not a Christian, > but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those > of Christianity.

Interesting, but again, when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances (although not always, I will admit, and probably it is the mass-oriented divisions which are the most appalling), it becomes irrelevant, unfortunately.  >  > I admit it is a word game. > i am going by the dictionary definition of religion: >    ``religion n. 1. concern over what exists beyond the visible world, >      differentiated from philosophy in that it operates through faith >      or intuition rather than reason, ...\'\' >                                    --Webster is >  > Now let us go beyond the word game.
