From: manu@oas.olivetti.com (Manu Das) Subject: overlapped window without a title bar   Hi,   I have a simple question. Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME window without a title bar; ie  \t(WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_THICKFRAME) & ~WS_CAPTION    I do not seem to be able to get rid off the title bar.  I have another question:  I have a overlapped window(say V) which has few child windows (a,b,c, etc) The window shows up with all it is children fine. Now, I create another  child(t) with a WS_THICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of it is siblings. Style WS_THICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it. How do I make sure that the child \'t\' will always be at the top of it is siblings. I used SetWindowPos() and BringWindowToTop() without success. what is happening is that while I am resizing \'t\' it shows up but as soon as I let go, it goes behild it is siblings.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Manu   Please mail me at manu@oas.olivetti.com
