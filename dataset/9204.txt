Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers, >1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you >can get him out 3 times out of 4?  I did not say that pitcher is fear of throwing strikes to guys like McGwire, Bonds, and Frank Thomas was rational.   I just said that it exists.  >Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even >though he has never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in >227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that is right, he has >*never* hit a homer in 916 AB is through the end of 1992. Who had be >afraid to throw a strike to him?  I do not know Alex Cole is batting style at all.   Some questions: How tall is he? Does he go into a crouch like Rickey Hederson/Pete Rose? Does he foul off a lot of pitches like Brett Butler? Does he take 1 or 2 strikes in each at bat?  It could be the Cole has a good batting  eye . Look above, I said that *many* high OBP guys draw their walks because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them, not  all  high OBP guys.
