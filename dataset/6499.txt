From: bradd@rigel.cs.pdx.edu (Brad A Davis) Subject: For Sale: 386/25MHz motherboard (or system) with 8 megabytes  I recently upgraded to a 486 and have found out I do not really have a need for my old 386.  i had prefer to sell just the motherboard and keep the case etc, so i shall offer the motherboard and case separately and let you decide.  i am asking $325 for the motherboard, which has:     25Mhz 386 DX (not SX)     8 megabytes of 32-bit, 70ns memory     AMI BIOS     based on C&T NEAT chipset     \t(this means the motherboard and bus circuitry timings are \tprogrammable - the BIOS\' advanced configuration menus let you \tselect system, DMA, bus clock, wait states, command delays, etc.)      baby AT  sized - fits in mini-tower, full-sized or most any other case (Includes User is Guide and a copy of the BIOS reference manual)  For $150 more you could have the rest of the system too:     full-size AT case with 200(?) watt power supply     2 serial, 1 parallel, 1 game ports     20Mb hard disk     1.2Mb floppy disk     keyboard     video card (choice of VGA or ???)  If you are interested, please give me a call.  The system is set up at my house in Aloha, and you are welcome to come test drive it.
