From: jrm@cbnews.cb.att.com (john.r.miller) Subject: Humminbird Depth Sounder forsale   Hi,  \tI have a Humminbird HDR200 Depth Sounder for sale. It has been used for 1 season on my sailboat.  \t \tAll parts are included as well as the installation instructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There is no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull. So it led a  sheltered  life. The transducer can be mounted either inside the hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole drilled into your hull.  \tIt is fully waterproof and fits into a 2  hole in a bulkhead (that is where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a powerboat. It reads depth to 199\' and has a backlit LCD display. It has an adjustable shallow water alarm built in.   \tI am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that outputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine and is very stable.   \tIt is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.   \tThe first 80$ takes it, or best offer.     \t\t\t\tJohn R.
