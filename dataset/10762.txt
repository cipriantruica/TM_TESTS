From: wcs@anchor.ho.att.com (Bill Stewart +1-908-949-0705) Subject: White House Wiretap Chip Disinformation Sheet  Fascinating.  Most of the content of the White House announcements was in what was *not* said.  It gives us almost nothing of value, threatens to take away a lot, and does it with a sincere smile on its face, and the nice friendly word  Management .  \t\t\t      FACT SHEET \t\t     PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The first thing it does not say is  we are giving you stronger encryption . what it says is     the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only    provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust    than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of    the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now, so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key.  Similarly, it did not say  we are making encryption is commercially available.  because encryption *is* already commercially available, including forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.  The next thing it did not say is  we are making encryption legal , because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the President cannot change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was: \tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the \tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving, \tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in \tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means  we are making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this.   Another thing it did not say is  we are going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping , because of course, there is a budget crisis, and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was:    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government is ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General    shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture    Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. which means  we have got money Congress cannot control and we are going to buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO (that is what  preserve the government is ability to conduct ... surveillance   means.)   --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
