One more way, which works in manual trans cars i have driven, and it is my personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this one, too).    While pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into position. If you do it right, the car will not jump backward, nor will the gears grind.... You will just glide back.  -sam
