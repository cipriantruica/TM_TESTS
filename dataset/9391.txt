Truly horrible.  \tDo you remember Game 7 of the 1988 NLCS, after the Dodgers defeated the Mets, and Ugh-a-dugh foo-boo fat stomach Tom Lasorda came running out on to the field in celebration?  YUCK!!!!!! \tHe undulated.  His arms flew up and down, keeping time with his rolling set of 9 stomachs, which flew all around the cozy confines of Chavez Ravine.  He oozed, like a white gastropod.  He ran.  It was a  disgusting sight.  Not only could not I watch my Mets in the Series, I had to watch Fat Stomach Lasorda roll around Dodger.... \tBLARGH!  >>But what made it memorable was what Karen eventually said about this, >>which was: >> >> I would rather sleep with a jar of Bill Landrum is spit under my pillow >> than look at Whitey Herzog in one of those uniforms.   \t If you like short, fat men, who grunt, curse, and spit a lot, Whitey is certainly your man  - Former WFAN host Pete Franklin, on The White Rat ... \tBut it is true, this emphasis on the appearance of ballplayers in tight uniforms only works if the player actually has an extraodinary  physique.  Looking at Charlie Hough is scrawny torso through those tight white shirts just sort of makes me decide,  Hmmm, I do not want to eat lunch today...or tomorrow...or anytime soon... . \tWhen Al Harazin first became Mets\' GM, he was asked if he intended to help redesign the Mets\' uniforms and change their image.  In particular, they asked him about the orange and blue racing stripe that runs down the  sides the uniforms.  He said that he has very much in favor of keeping them because  they are sleek and they are sexy . \tSid Fernandez, in a tight-fitting uniform, with a sleek racing stripe to denote speed and potencty.  Mmmmmmmm...lard. \tKevin McReynolds, diving after a fly ball.  Mmmmmmmm...Man O\' War, baby! \tPat Howell....well, never mind.  Nothing could be tight on him.  They do not make uniform sizes *that* small ... :-)  >Adam  Wishes he contribute something more interesting to r.s.b  Levin  Jason A. Miller  some doctor guy  Frank Tanana:  1-0, 1.50
