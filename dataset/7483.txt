From: mani@raunvis.hi.is (M\'ani Thorsteinsson) Subject: Lois Chevrolet?           I was whatching The History Of The Indy 500 the other day, and early in the film, around the \'10-\'20 is, a name, Lois Chevrolet, came out of the blue. I wanted to know if he is THE Chevrolet founder or mearly a driver who has name was called the same as the other guy is?:^)                                                  KONI.
