From: jdz1@Ra.MsState.Edu (John D. Zitterkopf) Subject: Info: NEC70001AB Amp. IC & ~20W AMP secs & possible PSPICE models  Hi,  \tBeing a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So,  i shall throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the \'net\'!  \tPlease Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No, Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:  \tAi [Current Gain] \tAv [Voltage Gain] \tAp [Power Gain] \tor whatever.  I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but I would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin?  SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag so it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in the latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas?   \tI thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp  models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 was not made for High power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this  E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me?   i am open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help! Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News...  And i shall post if there is and interest!
