From: azn30@RUTS.ccc.amdahl.com Subject: Compiling X programs   Hi Guys,  \tIt has been a long time since I wrote a program using X. I am trying to  \tget myself re-familiarize with X. I would appreciate your help regarding \tthe following problem.  \tI am trying to compile a simple X program on sun running sunOS 4.1.2.  \tusing \tcc -o ex ex.c -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm \tI am getting an error  \tld: Undefined symbol \t\t_get_wmShellWidgetClass \t\t_get_applicationShellWidgetClass    The simple program I tried to compile is given below.               main(argc,argv) int \targc; char\t**argv; { \tWidget\ttopLevel; \tWidget\tframe;  \ttopLevel = XtInitialize( ex , Ex ,NULL,0, &argc,**argv); \tframe = XtCreateManagedWidget( Form ,formWidgetClass,topLevel,NULL,0); \tXtRealizeWidget(topLevel); \tXtMainLoop(); }     \tI got the same error when I tried to build  xpostit  using the Imakefile \tprovided with the software.  \tI have compiled X programs before (not on this machine, but on other  \tmachines running sunOS 4.0 and X11 R4). I did not get this error message \tCan anybody tell me why I am getting these messages.  \tI would appreciate if you can email your responses to me at \tazn30@ruts.ccc.amdahl.com.  \tThanks \tAnand
