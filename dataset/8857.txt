From:  Subject: Re: White Sox Update  i think lamont is tryin sax out in left because he is messing with his mind.  he is trying to stir loose the mental block that he has had. sax was supposed to play in left last night (4-14) but we were rained out.  it is not like we need to add any more outfielders to our team.  it is mental  jimmy go sox, cubs suck!  (that is the white sox, dontcha know?)
