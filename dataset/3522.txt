Could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond     to what I/O addresses?      The U-B PCNIC (also OEMed by IBM for a while) is the only Ethernet card I know of that does not use I/O addresses.  It only has interrupts and shared memory.  The jumpers you see control bits 15-18 in the base address of the shared memory.  I cannot recall which is 1 and which 0, but that is easy to determine with DEBUG.  James B.
