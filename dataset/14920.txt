I have trouble thinking that God would allow anything to block our access to him in prayer, especially if we have sinned and are praying for forgivenenss.     I can see, however, how our prayer life might be hindered by our sin, if we are concentrating on what is causing the sin or what has happened, we may not be thinking about prayer, thus our prayers are \'hindered\' by our own actions.     But I do not think anything can \'block\' the transmission, or reception of prayer to God. Shalom,                                      Len Howard
