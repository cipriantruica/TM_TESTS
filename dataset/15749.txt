Probably got a real gut-buster going when the IRA blew that kid up a couple of weeks ago, huh?  Of course, in Britain, your government has ordered you defenseless, so your way of coping with violent criminals is to laugh at victims.  >pick-up truck in front of the car that my friend and I were in.

Where the criminals do not bother with checking to see if the victims are home.  They just break on in.  America is a little different, you see.  Criminals worry a bit more about getting shot, so they more frequently check to see if anyone is home.  >I knew somebody else who went to one of your  Gun-mart  superstore places, just >so he could experience the sight of people putting guns and ammo into shopping >carts! I did not believe it myself until I drove by one in Vegas last year!!!  i have heard Gun World in Phoenix, Arizona, is fantastic!  i am hoping to visit there myself soon.  >Now that I live in Britain, I can see how the rest of the civilized world >perceives you gun-nut morons. The BBC recently referred to the American  >penchant for pistols, automatic weapons,etc.  very  appropriately - it was >called a  national eccentricity.   Ah, Britain again.  is not that the place where you are guilty until proven innocent?  Tell me, Mr.  jaj@vax.oxford.ac.uk  did not Britain come begging to us  gun nut morons  in the early 1940s for guns to defend yourselves against Hitler?  Seems as though your supposedly  enlightened government had disarmed you:  Aw chaps, you can jolly give up your guns.  If that Hitler man starts to threaten, we can  always hit up the Yanks for a few guns.  they have got a bloody eccentric habit about those guns, you know.  Just hand in your shotgun, that is it.  Thank you.    >The only problem is that Canada, I hear, is suffering from your national >eccentricity, in that easy to purchase weapons are being smuggled cross the >border.  am not it just amazing how those black markets work?  Damn if those drugs from south america keep coming over our borders, too, even though we have banned them.  Guess we might as well legalize them.   Makes you want to send fifty bucks to the Libertarian Party just thinking about it, does not it?   >Anyway, all you gun nut Rush Limbaugh fans, please *keep* up your diatribes >against Brady and other  evil  Liberal media  plots  - you \'re so damn funny! >You provide endless amounts of entertainment in your arguments and examples of >why someone should be allowed to carry a piece!

Just chuckle as the cops beat you senseless to get a confession. Just laugh yourself silly when you find that confession is valid in court.   Hey mate, this is justice, British style.
