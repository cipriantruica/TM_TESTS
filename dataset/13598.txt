Subject: Space FAQ 01/15 - Introduction From: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)  Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO      INTRODUCTION      This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you do not want to see the FAQ, add \'Frequently Asked Questions\' to your KILL file for this group (if you are not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you are out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you are not surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you are on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit  Subject:  lines, especially if you are taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth \t100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST \tnot SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all \treferences.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you are \tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail \tor article), state your institution, etc. do not assume the \t\'reply\' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. do not post what everyone \twill get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping: \tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals \t(use carriage returns).       INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS      i have attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There is not     a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each     posting. Only those containing astronomy-related material are posted to     sci.astro (indicated by \'*\' following the posting number).       \tContents      1*\tIntroduction \t    Suggestions for better netiquette \t    Index to linked postings \t    Notes on addresses, phone numbers, etc. \t    Contributors      2*\tNetwork resources \t    Overview \t    Mailing lists \t    Periodically updated information \t    Warning about non-public networks      3*\tOnline (and some offline) sources of images, data, etc. \t    Introduction \t    Viewing Images \t    Online Archives \t\tNASA Ames \t\tNASA Astrophysics Data System \t\tNASA Jet Propulsion Lab (Mission Information and Images) \t\tNASA Langley (Technical Reports) \t\tNASA Spacelink \t\tNational Space Science Data Center \t\tSpace Telescope Science Institute Electronic Info.

Peter Yee and Ron Baalke have and continue to spend a lot of their own     time setting up the SPACE archives at NASA Ames and forwarding official     NASA announcements.      Many other people have contributed material to this list in the form of     old postings to sci.space and sci.astro which i have edited. Please let me     know if corrections need to be made.
