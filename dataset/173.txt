Assuming you are presenting it accurately, I do not see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion.  The material in John (i am not sure exactly what is referred to here, but i shall take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke  Q  material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus\' mouth.  >We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual >explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider >their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke >that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).  The version of the  usual theory  I have heard has Matthew and Luke independently relying on Mark and  Q .  One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew, we would not have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies, for one thing.  >As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke is text. The evidence >for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.  This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that you could point me to a reference, i had be grateful.  >>Unfortunately, I have not got the info at hand.

Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.  >>And I do not think a  one step removed  source is that bad.

The style and language >together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.  i am not really impressed with the  theology  argument.  But i am really pointing this out as an  if .  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter.   >One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times.

The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is not so bad.  >In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like >and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.  But the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, it is agreed that the most important epistles predate Mark. --  C.
