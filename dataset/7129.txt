Sorry, but *neither*  hadictates\' the cost. it is a negotiation. Whether it is up front at a honda dealership in an all out  dickering war, or more removed on a larger economic scale (ie, if saturn cannot sell at it is price, the price drops, or the company stops building them), it remains a negotiated value controlled by market forces. To think that the consumer  controls price is ludicrous. If the consumer controled price, then cars would be *free*...And no one would build  cars.
