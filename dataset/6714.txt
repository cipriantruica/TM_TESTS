Wal-Mart has Autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. Are these  real  platinum plugs? (I had Bosch platinums in my \'80 Fiesta and my dad had \'em in his \'84 Bronco--note the keyword  had.  They did not last very long (much less than 50,000mi) before they had to be replaced. I agree that they were not the greatest.)  \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
