A little money invested today is better than >being sick tomorrow and now being able to pay for it, or having to pay a lot >more tomorrow than you can today.  justify all you want.  extended warranties are a ripoff, high profit item for the dealer.  and you did not buy 5yr/60k, you get 3yr/36k *free*, so what you bought is 2yr/24k.  and you still have to pay $50 every time you use this  great \'warranty\'.  better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs if/when you need it.  considering that your last car was only 1.5 years old, are you sure you will even keep this new one past it is *free* warranty period? btw, typical profit on extended warranties is around 80%.  that is right, only 20% of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future repairs that the group of extended-warranty-people collect.
