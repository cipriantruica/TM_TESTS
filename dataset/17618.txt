Those that prefer teaching are under   | no pressure to publish.   |       When discussing and issue, it helps that all participants use the same   definitions, although this rarely occurs on Usenet.      When I use the term  university , I think of an organization that has   a Bachelors, Masters, and PhD program.  I believe that Cal State schools   do not.  I call them colleges.  UC schools are universities.  At a univeristy   the number one goal is to publish.  Cal State University system offers bachlors and masters degrees.  The Ph.D. is not offered, because of opposition from UC.    At the Cal State schools, do the professors you speak of have PhDs?  At  Nearly all the professors have PhDs.  I have not had a professor who did not, though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an M.A.  A friend had an instructor who did not have a degree at all, but because he had been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway. He had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class, and finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him to show up to teach.    a university you have professors with PhDs and then Teaching Assistants (TAs).   TAs were the slave labor, graduate students who got their tuition paid, and   a few hundred a month for living expenses in exchange for doing all the grunt   work.  The professors taught the lectures, with 100 to 500 students per class,   then the TAs taught the labs, with 20 to 30 per class.      Tim Fogarty (FOGARTY@SIR-C.JPL.NASA.GOV)  At Sonoma State University, typical class size is 20 to 30 per class. Teaching is definitely more the goal, and sometimes, it actually happens. The best professors at Sonoma State U. are equivalent to the best  professors I had at UCLA and USC. --  Clayton E. Cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer  My opinions, all mine!
