From: rkim@mars.uucp (Richard H.S. Kim) Subject: Need sources for HV capacitors.  Recently, my video monitor went dead, no picture, some low distorted sound. I did not hear the tell-tale cracking that indicated HV at work, nor are the filaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange, just nothing.  On examining the power board, I noticed the largest capacitor with a very bad bulge at the top.  Naturally, I want to replace it, but I cannot find any sources.  The electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV.  It has radial leads, and is roughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8  wide.  The dimensions are important since the whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room.  Living in the Los Angeles area, i have been to numerous stores (Dow Radio, All Electronics, ITC Elect, Sandy is, Yale Elect) with empty hands.  Can anyone suggest sources for high-voltage capacitors?  Mail order is  fine, although i had rather check out a store to compare the can.  i am going to try a video electronics store, hopefully they will have HV caps.  (By the way, the monitor is a ATARI SC1224, Goldstar circuitry, Masushita tube.  Anyone else had problems?)  Thanks in advance, Rich K.  email>  rkim@opus.calstatela.edu
