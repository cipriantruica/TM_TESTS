Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese which all have MSG in them.  It occurs naturally.  i am not going to quit eating something that I like just because it *might* cause me trouble later or causes problems in *some* people.  I would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting reports of what is good/bad for you.  I may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for me. Fine.  i have made my decision and I do not think it is appropriate for anyone to try to \'convert\' me.   it is for your own good  are the most obnoxious and harmful words, IMO, in the English (or any other) language.  > >Altho\' your example of the ulcer is funny, it is not an >appropriate comparison at all.

Give people all the information but do not ram your decisions down their throats.  Julie DISCLAIMER:  All opinions here belong to my cat and no one else
