Thanks.  For speaking for all those who did not feel it was important enough to say something themselves.    I would not say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong to.  It represents a subset (that you do not belong to) of a larger group (which you do, if only because this is not a moderated group).  Look, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  Three that come to mind are as follows:  1) Say it subtly.  Result: it may not be clear. 2) Say it directly yet politely.  Result: probably it will spark some     interesting conversation. 3) Say it directly and obnoxiously.  Result: validity goes right out    the window.  >I would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature.  You realize that anything you say can, and most certainly will, be used against you.  --  Paul W.
