My point is that your implied position about the  Waco Massacre  is an assertion cum political position. According to a CNN poll, about 86% of Americans think the FBI acted properly, and a majority think they should have done it (the tear gas) a lot sooner. A large majority also believe the FBI was not at all responsible for the death of the victims, Koresh was. (let us avoid the kind of fruitless argument of the sort If A had not X had, then B might not have Y had....)  What you call the  Big Brother Chip  is right now a proposal under discussion, and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be banned.  Therefore neither justifies  any tactic is fair.  Thus the statement is nonsense. It is pernicious, because  any tactic  can lead to damaging others.  As I see you know from the tone of your reply, there is nothing personal intended.
