From: dma7@po.CWRU.Edu (Daniel M. Alt) Subject: Interesting conversion Problem   \tI have a very large (3x5 feet) file in Macintosh Canvas v2.something which I need to import into AutoCad 12 in the least disk-space intensive way possible.  (i.e. EPS is a big problem, since it took 1.3 MEG to encode one page of the document)  The file is entirely lines and words.  I have access to networked Macs & PC is, and ftp.  Can anyone suggest how this might be accomplished?  Email replies, if you would, I do not read this group much. Thanks in advance. --  Daniel Alt  \tCase Western Reserve University Cleveland, OH (Help me!)
