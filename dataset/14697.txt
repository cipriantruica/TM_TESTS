From: jsledd@ssdc.sas.upenn.edu (James Sledd) Subject: Serbian genocide Work of God?  Are the Serbs doing the work of God?  Hmm...  i have been wondering if anyone would ever ask the question,  Are the governments of the United States and Europe not moving to end the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs because the targets are muslims?  Can/Does God use those who are not following him to accomplish tasks for him?  Esp those tasks that are punative?  James Sledd no cute sig....  but i am working on it.
