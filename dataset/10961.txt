From: jhart@agora.rain.com (Jim Hart) Subject: Screw the people, crypto is for hard-core hackers & spooks only   Since the AT&T wiretap chip is scheduled to be distributed  internationally, allowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign  governments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic  citizens, this is a world-wide issue.  Thus Distribution: world.  ygoland@wright.seas.ucla.edu (The Jester) writes:  >However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please, who >cares about the clipper chip?   Why do we hackers care about the Clipper chip?  Do we give a shit about anybody is privacy accept our own?  And perhaps not even our own; are we so smart that we always know when we are talking to somebody who has a wiretap on their phone?  I find the  call thru your computer  ideas may reflect this attitude. Ideas that are of, by, and for hackers, and do not help anybody in the real world, are not going to do anybody much good, including ourselves where voice phones are concerned.  We *do* need an alternative to NSA-bugged telephones, but we are talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized cellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.  Make-shift computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that does not  do anything for anybody is privacy in the real world.    What we need is a true *privacy chip*.  For example, a real-time  voice-encryption RSA, silicon compile it and spit out ASIC.   Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international  business, diplomats, and private communications.  If the U.S. bans  it, we make it somewhere else and import it.  The Japanese, German, Dutch, Taiwanese, Korean, etc. electronics companies do not want the  NSA spying on them.  U.S. workers lose more jobs to government fascist stupidity.  jhart@agora.rain.com
