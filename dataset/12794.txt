Though I cannot imagine WANTING to have intercourse during a full-blown yeast infection :-) chances of it being transmitted to the male are quite low, especially if he has circumcised.  But it can happen.  At one point I was getting recurrent yeast infections and the Dr suspected my boyfriend might have gotten it from me and be reinfecting me.  The prescription was interesting.  For each day of the medication (a week) I  was to insert the medication, then to have intercourse.  The resulting  action would help the medicine be spread around in me better, and would  simultaneously treat him.
