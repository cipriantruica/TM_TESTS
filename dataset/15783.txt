Page E7 (in the  Sporting Green  section) has a Trader is advert.  (The copy is a bit screwed up - it says that the prices offered expire 4-14-93, but the ad is there.)  The SF Examiner and Chronicle run the same set of adverts (because they have a joint printing/biz agreement and differ only in editorial content).  i have seen gun ads recently in the merc, which is anti-gun editorially, albeit not from traders, but from its competitors.  I do not know about the other papers.  Does Traders claim that things are changing?  When?  >- Why TV journalists lie  Because it is easier than telling the truth and no one much cares either way.  >Let me know if you write to any of these bozos.  Before you do, make sure that the bozos are actually doing what you are accusing them of.  -andy --
