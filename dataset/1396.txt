Specifically the 48-bit color?  that is 280 : trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve.  Is this an anti-aliasing thing?  Or : is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.   \ti am pretty sure most industry strength image processing specific  systems (i.e. photo processing gear) use as much as 96 bits of color info. Why? Why not, oversampling is never a bad idea especially if the hardware is only task is image manipulation, and profressional photographers demand professional results.  : \tAlso, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are SGI is flagship products?  I know of : Iris, Indigo, and Crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line? : (sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)  \tStrange question, but anyway, there is the VGX line, the newer Indigo^2, and the Onyx systems are the new big boys on the block (you can get a 24 processor system with twice the graphics performance of a reality engine). there is more, but I do not have my handy  periodic  table of sgi is  on me...   \t\t\tKeith
