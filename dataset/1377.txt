From: rfbohan@unix1.tcd.ie (Bones) Subject: Human Body data sets needed urgently  Hi all.  i am looking for datasets of a human body or head  in any of the popular formats.  i am doing a presentation tomorrow which could be greatly enhanced by bringing in this \'human\' factor.  i have looked around the net with no sucess so far.  Anyone got any ideas? i had also appreciate info on the location of datasets for the USS Enterprise (any model) Thanks in advance, Ronan
