From: kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Keith Keller) Subject: Observations  On the Lindros  trade :  Like Ottawa would be stupid enough to get Lindros.  Why do you think Quebec traded him?  Lindros would go on personal strike again...maybe I should talk to Ottawa mgmt. about arranging such a trade....  ;-)  On that xenophobe:  Thankfully nobody agreed with him publicly.  Maybe we should look at baseball, the supposed  American  pasttime (sp?).  Look at all the damn Latin Americans playing there!  They should all be deported!  They are not American!  (add sarcasm to taste)  To Roger:  Wow, for once we agree.  I hope this is not a sign of things to come.... i shall become a ranting lunatic who talks about nothing but the Leafs being the best in the Campbell.  ;-)  On the Rangers:  I told someone that nothing that happened in the Patrick would surprise me anymore.  I lied.  How the hell can a team go into Washington, earn a shutout, then come back home and lose to pitiful Hartford?  The absolute *pinnacle* of mediocrity.  I cannot stand it. From what i have read, the goalie is to blame this time, as Beezer played pretty poorly.  Smith is talking about calling up Corey Hirsch from Binghamton, everybody is pointing fingers... this is definitely not the same team which wanted to prove itself in Washington.  *Now* nothing that happens in the Patrick will surprise me.  (Yeah, right... ;-)    --     Keith Keller\t\t\t\tLET\'S GO RANGERS!!!!! \t\t\t\t\t\tLET\'S GO QUAKERS!!!!! \tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\t\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
