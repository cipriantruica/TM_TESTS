From: borden@head-cfa.harvard.edu (Dave Borden) Subject: Drug Use and Policy in Japan  Is anyone out there knowledgeable on drug issues in Japan?  i am interested in knowing if Japan has or has ever had a problem with drugs, and how they dealt with it.  i have heard, undocumented, that Japan years ago used heavy legal penalties to end a serious heroin problem.  i had like to know both sides of the story.  Does anyone recall such a problem?  What were laws at the time relating to drug use, drug dealing, and drug trafficking?  What are the laws now?  What other anti-drug measures, like education and treatment has Japan used?  How are drugs regarded by the Japanese people?  How effective have anti-drug measures been in Japan?  Thanks for your help.     - David Borden     borden@m5.harvard.edu
