I do not want him nuked, I want him to be honest.  The junk mail has been much more interesting than the promised catalog.  If i had known what I was going to get, I would not have hesitated.  I would not be surprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said  nope  but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results. Similarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who are not happy with the junk they got instead.  The folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad, and so would the people reading it.  -andy --
