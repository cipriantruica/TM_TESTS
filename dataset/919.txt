From: u895027@franklin.cc.utas.edu.au (Mark Mackey) Subject: Raytracers: which is best?  Hi all! \ti have just recently become seriously hooked on POV, but there are a few thing that I want to do that POV will not do (penumbral shadows, dispersion etc.). I was just wondering: what other shareware/freeware raytracers are out there, and what can they do? i have heard of Vivid and Polyray and  Rayshade and so on, but i had rather no wade through several hundred pages of  manual for each trying to work out what their capabilities are. Can anyone help? A comparison of tracing speed between each program would also be  mucho useful. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Mackey                 | Life is a terminal disease and oxygen is          mmackey@aqueous.ml.csiro.au | addictive.
