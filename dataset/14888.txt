Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on  Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the Branch Davidian  cult  from the Presbyterian  church ?  Doctrinal differences do not answer the question, IMHO, so do not use them as an answer.    -- Scott at Brandeis  \t But God demonstrates His      The Lord bless you, and keep you; \t own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you, \t while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you; \t Christ died for us. \t       the Lord lift up His countenance on you, \t\t\t\t       and give you peace.  \t\t-- Romans 5:8 [NASB]\t\t-- Numbers 6:24-26 [NASB]  [There have been some attempts to characterize  cult .  Most commonly it uses characteristics involving high pressure, brainwashing techniques, etc.  But some people characterize it by doctrinal error.  In the end i am afraid it becomes a term with no precise meaning that is used primarily to dismiss groups as not worthy of serious consideration.  That does not mean that there are not groups that do highly irresponsible things and have serious doctrinal errors.  But past discussions have not suggested to me that  cult  is a very helpful term.  --clh]
