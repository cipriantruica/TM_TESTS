The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE, it depends on the drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr. it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly 4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the controller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast speed. I haven\xef\xbe\xb4t used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice.  \t\t\t\t\t\tdieter  --  Dieter Fritzsche                                      dieter@dischw.toppoint.de Maehlsweg 32 ,D-2300 Kiel 17, Germany                         Master of the WOM Tel   .: +49 431 362705 (Voice) FAX BOX: +49 431 361437 ZyXEL-V.fast-Waffle/FAX\t\t compuserve  100060,654
