Will someone who can  isee\' the X-Face included in this header please reply and tell me if it turned out okay?  i am not all too sure about my viewing software.

Use Paintbrush to touch up manually. \t4. Use WinGIF to \'reduce\' it by half again. \t5. Use Paintbrush to touch up again. \t6. Use WinGIF to \'reduce\' it by half *again* \t\tand convert it to *.GIF.  \t\t[now over to the UNIX side...]  \t7. Use Snapshot to convert the *.GIF to a Sun rasterfile. \t8. Use IconEdit to touch it up and \t\tconvert it to an X bitmap. \t9. Use  vi  (yes, a *text* editor) to manually convert \t\tthe rasterfile into the  Uncompressed X-Face  format. \t\t(Lots of global  ed  commands, and by the time you are \t\t done you shall mirror hex bytewise in your sleep!!)  \t\t[now over to the *Linux* side...]  \tA.
