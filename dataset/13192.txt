From: aldridge@netcom.com (Jacquelin Aldridge) Subject: Sweet is Syndrome ?   \tMy brother is affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet is syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet is syndrome.  \tThis syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism. she had been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it.   \tI understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but she is is not being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the hospital because of the Sweet is syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).  i have looked through the last two years of Medline and did not find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. .   I checked a handbook which said that Sweet is was associated with leukemia.  i had like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.  Any information that might help. Apparently there has not been much improvement in her condition over the past several months.   -Jackie-
