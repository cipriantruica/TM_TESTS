From: bsardis@netcom.com (Barry Sardis) Subject: Re: Date is stuck  i have posted a couple of notes about encountering this problem. Based on some  suggestions from:  Mark Aitchison, University of Canterbury, New Zealand. \tand Chris A. Larrieu    I think that my problem is a screen saver that also outputs sound (to my  PC speaker). i am still looking at some of the other screen savers that I  use (with a randomizer), but this one definately caused the loss of several  minutes over night (but not the date this time).  --  Barry Sardis\t\t| Home:   (408) 448-1589 1241 Laurie Avenue\t| Office: (408) 448-7404 San Jose, CA 95125\t| Fax:    (408) 448-7404 Email: bsardis@netcom.COM or 70105.1210@compuserve.COM
