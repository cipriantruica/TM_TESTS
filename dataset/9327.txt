Awesome defense.)  >>Darnell Coles  he has still around because of his 1986, when he hit 20 HR.  >>Henry Cotto  has not played 10+ years in the bigs.  was not a full-time major-leaguer until 1988.  >Manny Mota.

Same goes for Herm.  >Lonnie Smith (not light hitting, but a horror in the field)  does not count then.  >Gary Redus  Redus is hardly light-hitting, plus he stole 300 bases.  Close to 800 OPS career against LHP.  >Dion James  we will see if he has still around in 1995 to qualify.  >Daryl Boston  Slugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters\' parks in the NL.  he has going to be one of Colorado is better players this year.  Plus, to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver and Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox.  >Vince Coleman (yeah, he has finally started to have a decent OBP)  Coleman, assuming he makes it to 1994, was never perceived as being weak offensively, though of course he was.  Led NL in SB his first six years in the majors.  >Cecil Espy  we will see if he has still around in 1997.  >Willie Wilson  Wilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year stretch and led the league in triples five times.  But we can count him if he has still playing in 1994, though it shall be because he has Otis Nixon deluxe with slightly worse defense.  >Gary Pettis  Okay, if he has in the league this year, he can count, though he has also in the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome.  >Milt Thompson  he has not spectacular, but he has neither light-hitting nor a ten-year man.  >Gary Varsho  Halfway there, and unlikely to make it 3/4 of the way there.  >OK, I admit to taking a quick browse through the Major League Handbook, but >only after the first 7 or 8.

Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease, but he was not perceived as light-hitting.  Neither was Curt Flood.  Cesar Cedeno was *not* light- hitting.  >>Note:  These guys may not have reached 10 years yet, but they have got >>to be close. > >Likewise for my list. Oh, and a prediction: Milt Cuyler.  he shall have to steal a lot more bases. --  ted frank                 |  thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |         i am sorry, the card says  Moops.  the u of c law school     |  standard disclaimers      |
