I do not buy it.  If the things had no value at all, people would not spend money to make them. So their lack of value is just your opinion, not an actual fact, which is neither a philisophical or legal basis for prohibiting them.  On the other hand, I lived in OakBrook IL for a while, where zoning laws prohibit billboards, as you mention above.  I think it was a fine law, despite it is contradictory basis.  I would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would be violation of private property.   I bought this house, out in the boondocks, specifically to enjoy my hobby, amateur astronomy.  Now this billboard has made that investment worthless, so I want the price of the property, in damages.   It would not take too many succesful cases like that to make bill-sats prohibitively expensive.  -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk     They communicated with the communists, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm   and pacified the pacifists. -TimBuk3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
