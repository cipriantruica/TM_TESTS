Never said you did not publish, merely that there is data you do not publish,  and that no-one scoriates you for those cases.    IBM research  publishes plenty, it is why you ended up  with 2 Nobel prizes in the last 10 years,  but that some projects are deemed company confidential.  ATT Bell Labs,  keeps lots of stuff private, Like Karamankars algorithm.  Private moeny is entitled to do what it pleases, within the bounds of Law,  and For all the keepers of the temple of SCience,  should please shove their pointy little heads up their Conically shaped Posterior Orifices.     pat  \twho just read the SA article on Karl Fehrabend(sp???)
