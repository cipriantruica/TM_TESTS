You are much more likely to do some good writing to local newspapers, and broadcast news shows.  If you do, keep the letter short and to the point so they do not discard it out of hand, and emphasize exactly what you are upset about.  it is possible that the local health department can help you complain to  someone official, but really, that \'clinic\' exists for the sole purpose  of generating walk-in income through advertising, and *nothing* you can do  will change them -- all you can hope for is to help someone else avoid them.  i am glad it sounds like your son did ok, anyway.  My opinion only, of course, Steve
