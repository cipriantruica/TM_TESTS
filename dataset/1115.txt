The cost is $299, but there  are no license royalties. His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento, CA phone  916/737-1550. He does not have email. Very nice guy... very knowledgeable about  graphics. Seems like he may have a decent package. it is an Object Pascal Framework  that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes.   i am going to check it out and see if it is got what I need for my CAD package.   I also found another package: 3D Graphic Tools by Micro System Options in Seattle.  The number is: 206/868-5418, also no email. The package is strong at ray tracing,  i am not too sure about its geometry creation tools. I also need to look into this  package some more. I also spoke with the author, Mark Owens, another nice  guy that seems to know his business. The price is $249, no royalties.  BobC
