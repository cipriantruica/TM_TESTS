I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really was not too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this does not work for Motif, you had have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So  your constructor should know how to convert a   into the proper resource identifier. i had check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything )     Alex.   -- __  __|              __|       Alex Colburn                      |       /        |          Image Analysis Facility          |      _____     __|\t       University of Iowa           ______| _/      _  _|          colburn@tessa.iaf.uiowa.edu
