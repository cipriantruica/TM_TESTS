Unfortunately, It is VL-Bus \tonly (They may have an ISA version by now...?) from a company \tcalled Metheus. The address and phone number is:  \t\t\tMetheus Corp \t\t\tOGC Science Park \t\t\t1600 NW Compton Dr. \t\t\tBeaverton, OR  97006-6905 \t\t\t(503)-690-1550 \tBe aware, this is a very high-end card, capable of 4MB of VRAM, \tso it does not come CHEAP. But, I have personally seen TWO of \tthese boards running a dual screen Windows 3.1.   |> Lance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com) |>                Yes, that IS a \'%\' (percent sign) in my network address. |> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |> All statements, comments, opinions, etc. herein reflect those of the author |> and shall NOT be misconstrued as those of IBM or anyone else for that matter.  --  Mark Hall Intergraph Corporation Huntsville, AL mhall@habu.b11.ingr.com (205) 730-6145
