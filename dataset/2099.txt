You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the  mid-late 80 is, MS is point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over the world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS (and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2. The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people until they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the  wayside.  Then Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to be doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either stayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that point in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the short term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS 3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS is refocussing on DOS and Windows. Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will offer even more in terms of  real  OS features (I work on NT and have no real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a few years ago).  \t...Dave  Of course these are my opinions. If you want MS is opinions, as a PR person.
