What next?   No more French Canadiens?  Yeah, there is an idea!  Let them French- speaking Canadiens have their own hockey league!  We do not want them! \tAre you _CRAZY_?  The NHL is one of the true international leagues, and yes, there _ARE_ many Europeans who deserve to play in the NHL and are better than some North Americans, look at Teemu!!! I, for one, am glad to see Europeans in the NHL and I hope the NHL soon expands to Europe.  Its nice to see all these different people come together to form the (soon to be) 26 hockey teams. \t >  >  >--  >Richard J.
