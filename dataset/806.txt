From: oehler@picard.cs.wisc.edu (Eric Oehler) Subject: Translating TTTDDD to DXF or Swiv3D.  I am a Mac-user when it comes to graphics (that is what I own software and hardware for) and i have recently come across a large number of TTTDDD format modeling databases.  Is there any software, mac or unix, for translating those to something I could use, like DXF?  Please reply via email.  Thanx. Eric Oehler oehler@picard.cs.wisc.edu
