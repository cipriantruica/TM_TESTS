The Janus Report, which came out recently, gives 9% as the percentage of exclusively or predominantly gay men.  3. No one is presumably going to say they are gay if they are not. But some no doubt are going to hide their homosexuality in surveys. Thus the 1-2% is a lower limit.  I still say that weighing all the evidence gives a most likely percentage between 5 and 7%.
