Usually   (ideally) well-founded, motivated such, but nonetheless personal. The   fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question,   even for the same reason, does not make morals objective; it   humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question,   which can be good for the evolution of a social species.     if a  real large lot  (nice phrase) of people agree that there is a   on a desk, i am supposed to see a logical difference between the two?  Perhaps you can explain the difference to me, since you seem to see it   clearly.    (rest deleted)     that is a fallacy, and it is not the first time it is pointed out.  it is not a fallacy - note the IF.   IF a supermajority of disinterested people  agree on a fundamantal value (we are not doing ethics YET Benedikt), then what  is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial observation?   For one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. Unlike  a football. Further, you conveniently ignore here that there are  many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. The analogy   not hold.  I have, however, given an example of a VALUE people agree on, and explained why.  People will agree that their freedom is valuable.  I have also stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective ethics - the IF assertion above.  And that is what i am talking about, there is not a point in talking about ethics if this cannot be agreed.   One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,   YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees  with a set of morals YOU have to give.  i am not doing morals (ethics) if we cannot get past values.  As I say, the only cogent objection to my \'freedom\' example is that maybe people are not talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable. Maybe not, and I want to think about this some, especially the implications of its being true.    the above is evidence, not proof. Proof would evolve out of testing  your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.  Garbage.  that is not proof either.   The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer   objections. Evidence that you are a preacher.  Name that fallacy. --  Frank O\'Dwyer                                  \'i am not hatching That\' odwyer@sse.ie                                  from  Hens ,  by Evelyn Conlon
