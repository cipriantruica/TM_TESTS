From: wellison@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu Subject: Re: electronic odometers  I had the insturment panel go out in my car (a 1990 Lincoln Contenintal) which is a digital dash. They replaced the whole thing with a 1991 dash (thank god it was under the warrenty ! :-) Anyway, the odometer was reading the exact milage from the old panel. It must have a EEPROM of some sort in it that is up-dated. Seems to me that removing the battery would erase it, but it does not. So I guess they swapped the NVM chip (non-volitile memory) and installed it in the new dash. No, they would not let me have the old dash to tinker with :-(   -=-= Wes =-=-
