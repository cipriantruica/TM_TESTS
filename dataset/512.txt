From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an introduction to the article  Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon , by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by Paul Kurtz.   \tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of \tthe world is fastest growing religions, with as many as \t200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church is \taggressive missionary program, covering more than one \thundred countries, it is spreading even to third world \tcountries. \t \tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and \tevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict \tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly \treceives revelations directly form God, and a group of \ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief \tand practice, the church is opposed to abortion, \tpornography, sexual freedom, women is rights, and other, in \tits view, immoral influences of secular society, and it \tforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea. \t \tCentered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy \tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western \tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft \tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family, \tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed \tgovernment officials. \t \tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by \tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had \tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill \tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he \thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of \tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written  by \tthe commandment of God,  claims that the ancient Hebrews \tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors \tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who \thave been baptized in the  true church  will be reunited \tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can \tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the \thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been \tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and \tas heretics by religious fundamentalists. \t \tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was \tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because \tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from \tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois, \twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham \tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over \tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further \twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City.  \tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of \tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice \tin nineteenth-century America. \t \tWhile other religions go back many centuries -- \tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism, \t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are \tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon \troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this \thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny \tis dangerous to the faith. \t \tIn the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles \tabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong \tmember of the church, provides a detailed critical \texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of \tMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion \tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a \tMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the \thistory of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz \t  The article itself is super.    ,...,.,,  /666;    \',     ////;    _~ -    (/@/----0-~-0  ;\'  . `` ~  \'   , `    \' , > ;;| ..((   -C---->> jimtims p00168@psilink.com  ;;| >-  `.__),;;
