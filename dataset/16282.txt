Drop three billiard balls on a ramp, and they all roll in the same direction.  Pour some blood into the sea, and sharks will converge from miles around.  Throw a pebble at one starling, and all 200 will depart.  Natural processes can mimic the outward results of conspiracy when no actual conspiracy is required.  Put a government functionary in an embarrassing situation, and he quickly covers his ass.  This, too, is completely natural.  > About Waco > It looks to me as the BATF and FBI cannot handle situations like this.  It looks that way to me, too.  But you have to understand that it is NOT  the first time they have instigated raids like these.  The most recent one ALSO ended up in a long standoff, but it was not quite as public as this one, and they did not kill quite as many people.  Maybe this  screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more  residences in this manner.  But probably not.  > The way it went reminds me of  istun\' bomb beeing dropped on a house > in LA from a helicopter. (Whole block went up in flames, 5 died...)  I assume you are talking about Philadelphia.  > It does not HAVE to be a conspiracy, MAYBE they just screwed up ???  If you are a fan of conspiracies, the time to make that batch of popcorn is AFTER the screwup, when it is time for the coverup. --   cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\' Packet...
