From: gtoal@gtoal.com (Graham Toal) Subject: Re: Do we need the clipper for cheap security?  : There are chips which perform the voice compression/expansion.  They cannot : be expensive, because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the : PBX line cards, as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses : voice-grade circuits to save the cost of long-distance, leased T1s or : satellite circuits.  : I cannot remember the generic term for these chips.  My impression is that : this was a big deal 10 years ago, but circuits have gotten so cheap that : it is not done much now.  Codecs.  They have to get about 6:1 compression on 8 bit samples to squeeze them down v32bis.  I played around with the lossless  ishorten\' program last night, but it only managed 2.5:1.  i have got some specimen CELP code but it is not obvious that it runs in real time; I think it is just proof-of- concept code, and I have some mucking about with file formats to do before I can put my own sample through it.  Looks like the current option is to use a voice-mail modem with built-in DSP chip to do this in hardware.  That means two modems for a system, putting the cost at $600 upwards.  Ouch.  Maybe soon we will be able to do it in software on high-powered games consoles - is not the 3DO an Acorn RISC machine inside?  That cpu runs like shit off a shovel... and will be nicely mass-market too.  G
