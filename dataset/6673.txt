This has me thinking.  Is there a biological reason why women cannot put their keys in their pants pockets like men do?  I have two pockets on the back of each of my pants.  I put my keys in one and wallent in another. Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely. Everything is that much simpler for me.  Why cannot women do the same? Is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents?
