I tend to agree.  I came here when it first started and watched it grow from the roots on talk.religion.misc.  It seemed to take a while for enough atheists to come forward to get past the  let us trash Xians  and such. Now there is a stable core, and frankly there is a feeling that this is _our_ group.  If we go mainstream, we are going to be in a lot more places.  And every fucking fundy loonie freshman will be dumping on us to find Jeesus! and warn us that we are all going to Hell.  Want to see what we will get?  Go real alt.fan.brother-jed and imagine that those imbecilic tirades will be here.  All the time.  Every other post.  i am being selfish.  I find I really learn a lot here and the S/N is not too bad.  The Browns and the Boobys are a distraction, but they are few enough that they even bring in some of the leavening needed to offset them.  But I greatly fear that mainstreaming would basically put us at the swamping level of the Conners of the world.
