I find the weight shift can be very sudden and \tunnerving. it is one thing if they are just getting comfortable or \tdecide to look over your other shoulder, but I do not recommend having \thim/her shift her weight with each turn... too violent. \t \tAlso (I think someone already said this) make sure your passenger \twears good gear. I sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or \tlacking other safety gear (depends on how squidly I feel) but I \twill not let passengers do it. What I do to myself I can handle, but \tI would not want to hurt anyone else, so I do not let them on without \tgloves, jacket, (at least) jeans, heavy boots, and a helmet that *fits*  >I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that >she will want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...  \tGo *real* easy. it is amazing how solid a grip you have on the \thandle bars that your passenger does not. do not make her feel like \tshe is going to slide off the back, and  snappy  turns for you are \tsickening lurches for her. In general, it feels much less controlled \tand smooth as a passenger. I cannot stand being on the back of my \tbrother is bike, and I ride aggressively when i ride and I know he has \ta good pilot... still, everything feels very unsteady when you are \ta passenger.    >Thanks, >        -Bob-  \tShow off by not showing off the first time out...  -------  This is where I wanna sit and buy you a drink someday.  - Temple of the Dog Sea-Bass Sears --> scs8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu --> DoD#516 <-- |Stanley, ID.|  \'79 Yamaha XS750F -- \'77 BMW R100S -- \'85 Toyota 4Runner --   |  NYC, NY.  |
