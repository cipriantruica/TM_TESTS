The NSA is supposed to develop cryptosystems. If the government chooses to go ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses, so be it.  \tThis sounds a lot like slamming the competition, not a cry for justice. These guys are way out on a limb, if I read that right. they have commited their new algorithm to silicon before it is been made public. What are they gonna do if Shamir writes a paper showing how to crack the entire class of algorithms in 5 minutes with a slide rule and a pencil?  \tIf they were not busy throwing muck to smear their competitors, i had feel kinda sorry for \'em. Still do, a little.  \tAndrew
