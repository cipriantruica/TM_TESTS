Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then i shall put in my $.02. \tFirst, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.  >\tThe political implications are simple.

That could be black women today, Asian >homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined >day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%)  >minority.  On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP is is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did. \tThe white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who did not participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.  \tMy opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let us change them. But do not blame me for what my ancestors did. It would not settle anything anyway.  >\tEither way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be >popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you shall still >be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I  >would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it >is the only way to go.  that is where you are dead wrong. You do not join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it does not make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).  \tIf you cannot beat them, fight them every inch of the way.   >Bill R.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur is mind.
