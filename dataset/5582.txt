From: carl@frost.bain.oz.au (Carl Sandland) Subject: Re: C++/Motif, gcc, silly messages  Thanks to everyone who mailed help, unfortunately the end problem was a REALLY stupid `oversight\' on my behalf. The code was 100% perfect, but it might help to add Control.C to my makefile.......  \tAnyway the mangled name was telling me it could\'nt locate the Control constructor...  \tI just want to reaffirm what a valuable book this one is, i am enjoying evry page :)
