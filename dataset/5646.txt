From: dls@Autodesk.COM (Daniel Louis Smith) Subject: Windows -> Motif tools SUMMARY   \tI posted this May 12th:   >         I am looking for info on products that can take > Windows source on a Unix box (such as Sparc), and produce a > Motif executable.  Another requirement is that MFC 2.0 should > be supported.  I already know of: >  >         Wind/U  by Bristol Technologies >         Hunter SDK >         MainWin by MainSoft >  >         Are there any others? >  > \tI will post a summary if it is wanted.   \tI got a few requests asking for a summary, so i shall attempt one here:   \tHere is the ones I know of:  \tWind/U\t\t- Bristol Technologies  \tHunter SDK\t- Hunter Systems  \tMainWin\t\t- MainSoft  \tLIBWXM          - Visual Solutions   \tHunter   \tThe company is going through some big changes.  I expect to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name.  At the moment, it is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info. Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down.   \tVisual Solutions  \tLIBWXM is a product that I just heard about.  They do not yet support MDI or MFC.  Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical modeling package.  Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol. Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  she is very helpful.  \tMainSoft  \tThis translates Windows source to a Unix executable that can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at runtime.  They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go straight to Xlib.  They do not yet support MFC.  they are at 415 896 0708.  \tBristol  \tThis company that seems to be on the right track.  Wind/U uses Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app.  They seem to be doing the most work in trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon. My contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles. they are at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.  --  \t\t dls@autodesk.com           dls@netcom.com      Daniel L Smith, Autodesk, Sausalito, California, (415) 332-2344 x 2580 disclaimer:  accuracy of statements corrrelates somehow to caffeine intake
