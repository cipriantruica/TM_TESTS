What it means is that parties are not dragged into court over and over again because the losing side  discovers  some  new  evidence.  I do not know about you, Brett, but I suspect GM had the resources to find just about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial started.  Letting them re-open the case now is practically an invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole in case the verdict goes against him.  BTW, in federal criminal cases, Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new trial  based on . . . *newly discovered* evidence  if made within 2 years of the verdict.  (Emphasis mine.)  If you are trying to make a backhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has little to do with criminal trials -- as the estimable David Brock did in his amusing WSJ piece last week -- save your breath.    >\tOr has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be  >believed?  >should not that be up to a jury?  Yup.  Which is why they shoulda been brought around the first time through.    >\tAnd what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk >shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM?  should not that be enough for >a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial? >\tWhatever happened to jurors having to be objective?  Unless there is some reason to believe that this supposed bias predated the trial (as opposed to being a product of it), and that GM was unfairly prevented from discovering it (by venireman concealment or otherwise), why should GM be allowed to complain?  --  MORAL: Always Choose the Right Sort of Parents         Before You Start in to be Rough                                         - George Ade \tMark Eckenwiler    eck@panix.com    ...!cmcl2!panix!eck
