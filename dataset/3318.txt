From: ph12hucg@sbusol.rz.uni-sb.de (Carsten Grammes) Subject: List of IDE Harddisk specs (21/04/93)  \t\t    Configuration of IDE Harddisks \t\t    ==============================   last update:\t14.4.1993  collected by Carsten Grammes (ph12hucg@rz.uni-sb.de) and published regularly on comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is explicitly NO WARRANTY that the given settings are correct or harmless. (I only collect, I do not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order to update the list.  If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!  Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for. If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of cylinders. If not specified the \'Write Precompensation\' should be set 65535. (There are BIOSes that do not even ask for it).  Another statement (maybe right): IDE harddisk do not have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter and lzone is not used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.  The jumpers\' names are given as printed on the HD is board, often only a jumper number (JP12 means the jumper \'12\'). A zero means that the jumper is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.    ***************************   C O N N E R   ***************************   \t\tConner Peripherals Drive Geometry  IDE/AT  Conner drives are low level formatted at the factory.

The factory default on SW2 is On Off Off Off Off Off (1-6). This sets the drive to be a single drive. Setting SW2 to Off On On Off Off Off makes it a slave drive. SW1 has been set to On Off Off On (1-4) all along.
