From: wdwells@nyx.cs.du.edu (David  Fuzzy  Wells) Subject: Boom!  Whoosh......   And one of my profs is the chief engineer for the project (Dr. Ron Humble, Univ. Colorado at Colorado Springs).  I love the idea of an inflatable 1-mile long sign.... It will be a really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt  (or even better, a Westford Needle!) comes crashing into it at 10 clicks a sec.      Whooooooooshhhhhh......      I hear  that it will supposedly coincide with the Atlanta Olympics.   \t\t\t\t\t\tFuzzy. =============================================================================== _ __/|       | Lt.
