The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as officers and yelling  Police  repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug houses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it is a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight.  Usually this strategy works; if it did not, then it would not be used so commonly, now would it?  Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my point, since I do not think any of us have enough information to make a clear judgement on this issue.  I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day. Furthermore, we do not know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers is badges?  Just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they reasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which cannot be faked by the  competition ?  Even if you have got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that is not an excuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD is, there was almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops. --  *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)\t*       ___ *\t\t\t\t\t* _____/_o_ _____ *\tTwinkle, twinkle, little .sig,\t*(==(/_______ )==) *\tKeep it less than 5 lines big.\t*  == /      /==/
