(okay they use modern methods toa point).  I am talking the guy who coem to Nome evry year, sets up his tent on the beach (the beach was washed away last year) and sets up his/her sluice box and goes at it  mining . I know the large corps, such as Alaska Gold Company, might complain to..  My opinions are what I learn at the local BS table..  My original thing/idea was that the way to get space mining was to allow the eco-freaks thier way.. As they have done with other mineral development. You cannot in many places cannot go to the bathroom in the woods without some form of regulation covering it..   == Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- i am not high, just jacked
