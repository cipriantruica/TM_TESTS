From: ST702459@brownvm.brown.edu () Subject: Mac Modem Wanted  I would like to buy a cheap modem for my Mac. Did I mention that I would prefer it to be cheap?  2400 baud preferred, but when you are looking for cheap (and I do mean cheap) beggars cannot be choosers.  E-mail me.  Oh, i am in Seattle, so if you were also, that would be a bonus.
