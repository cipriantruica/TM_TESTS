I do not have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS -- i am sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does.  Do you really think that in the absence of a double-blind study I should be indifferent to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS?  For what it is worth, I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin for  candida hypersensitivity syndrome.   It was published in the  New England Journal (I think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic symptoms (though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not surprisingly).  As I recall, the yeast crowd had some major objections to the study, though I do not remember what they were.  --  David Rind rind@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu
