Just because a fax modem behaves like a printer on a  local  machine, does not guarantee functionality  when a  local  machine has fax software printing to a  remotely installed  fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the  fax software did not like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX is peculiarisms but I do not think so.  A lot of special hardware interaction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX manager program merely  intercepts  the print job and spools it to it is own directory, not print manager is spool directory.  To software, it appears the job was  printed .  Print Manager  plays NO part in the handling of the actual process.  Pardon me if i have incorrectly assumed this is what you were up to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.  Good luck.
