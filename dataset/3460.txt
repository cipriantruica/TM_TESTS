From: johnn@eskimo.com (John Navitsky) Subject: Monitors - Nanao?  Hello, i have been following discussions on 17  monitors in  comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good reviews.  i am interested in getting more information about Nanao is products as well as some others that may fit the bill.     I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI. i am envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large (=>17 ) if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  i have been very happy with a 16  on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home.  i am interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on Sun is fairly often and look pretty good (to me at least).  I have not seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are Mag and Viewsonic.  Ok, stuff i had like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are the products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. what scan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  what is list and street cost - if avail. from a third party, and where can I get ahold of them?  Same info for Sony and Hitatchi.  Thank you very much!!   --   ,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,  ,`,`John Navitsky`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`johnn@eskimo.com,`,`,`,  ,`,`Exercise a right today,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,  ,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,
