From: mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Michael D. Walker) Subject: Re: The doctrine of Original Sin   \t  \tJust a quick reminder:    \tThe way you are interpreting those passages is your opinion.  You make \tit sound as if your opinion is somehow an undisputable fact.  \tMany would interpret the passages you cite very differently.  \t(Many have--several of the great theologians you mentioned do that  \tvery thing.  These were people who had much more expertise in the \tinterpretation of scripture than you or me or probably anyone reading \tthis newsgroup.  To say that all of them are wrong and you are right \tis, in my opinion, (notice those last three words) coming pretty darn \tclose to the sin of pride.    \tIn the future I would suggest you not be so absolutist in your  \tinterpretations, especially when contradicting highly respected \tdoctors of Christianity.  \t\t\t\t\t- Mike Walker \t\t\t\t\t  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu \t\t\t\t\t  (Univ. of Illinois)
