It is such a strong tranquilizer that it is probably best refered to as a hypnotic, rather than a tranquilizer. Just one pill will knock you on your ass. Side effects may be similar to valium, xanax, serax, librium and other benzodiazepines.  --  ============================================================================= Neal Howard   \'91 XLH-1200      DoD        CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX) \t      doh     |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org \t      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac is.
