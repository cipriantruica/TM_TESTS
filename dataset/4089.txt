From: deguzman@after.math.uiuc.edu (A A DeGuzman) Subject: Non-Apple Mini-Docks available?  My boss is considering the purchase of a Powerbook or Duo. He is leaning towards a 180, because of the math coprocessor (for Mathematica), but would get a Duo if he could find a Mini-Dock with a coprocessor. Have any third-parties announced such a beast?  -- Alan A. DeGuzman                  Genius is never understood in it is own time.
