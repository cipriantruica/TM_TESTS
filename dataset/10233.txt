The Arena is been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just take winning for granted.  it is been seemingly forever since the team lost, and we have forgotten what it is like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory.  While i am glad to have the Pens doing so well, in some ways it was a better high back when the Pens beat the Bruins two years ago, and the Rangers last year. Too much of a good thing is not always good for you.  rick
