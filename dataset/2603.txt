From: cca20@keele.ac.uk (J. Atherton) Subject: Serial Printing  Hi, \twe have been having problems on a few setups when printing to a serial printer (dmp or Laser). I have used Works and Windows Write. The output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output, but anything fancy garbles or just does not output. The exception is outputting to a Lserjet 4 which \'appears\' to be fast enough receiving data, not to bother about handshaking messages. i am sure i am not alone in this. i have tried most of the Print/Network manager options I can think of. Anyone had similar problems they have cured and would like to tell me \'bout it?? Thanks  John Atherton
