Good question!  I kind of wondered about this myself.  Just one thought I had on it  -  the Babe himself was IN  Pride of the Yankees , which made me think  a) that version may be closer to the truth, and  b) the Babe must have been a pretty good gut to be in the movie even though some of the scenes did not make him look completely flattering.  --  Chris Roney  (e-mail chris_roney@sfu.ca)
