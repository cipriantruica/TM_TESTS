From: lioness@maple.circa.ufl.edu Subject: Kubota Kenai/Denali specs   Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I will post a summary of their capabilities.  I have not actually used one or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  i had like to see an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or something.  Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that run OSF/1 ( DEC is ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are binary compatible with Digital is OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by simply adding  transformation engines .  The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.   \t\t\t3400\t\t\t3500  CPU\t\t\tDEC Alpha AXP 133MHz\tDEC Alpha AXP 150MHz On-chip cache\t\t8k/8k\t\t\t8k/8k Onboard cache\t\t512K\t\t\t512K Word Size\t\t64-bit\t\t\t64-bit Memory ( initial )\t32-128MB\t\t32-256MB Memory ( future )\t512MB\t\t\t1GB SPECMARK89\t\t111\t\t\t126 SPECINT92\t\t75\t\t\t84 SPECFP92\t\t112\t\t\t128  GRAPHICS  Transform Modules\t1-6\t\t\t1-6 Frame Buffer Modules\t5,10,20\t\t\t5,10,20 Frame Buffer\t\t1280x1024x24bit\t\t1280x1024x24bit \t\t\tdouble buffered\t\tdouble buffered Z-buffer\t\t24-bit\t\t\t24-bit Alpha/stencil\t\t8-bit\t\t\t8-bit Stereo support\t\tyes\t\t\tyes Other:\t\t\t\tboth machines will double buffer or do \t\t\t\tstereo output per window.

The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture known as Denali.  The Denali comes in three models, the E, P, and V.  They use a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz.  Their capabilities are as follows:  \t\t\tE\t\tP\t\tV  2D Vectors\t\t800-200K\t2000-3800K\t4000-4800K 3D Vectors  \t\t350-1100K\t1100-1800K\t1800-2100K 3D Vectors  \t\t300-1000K\t1000-1600K\t1600-1900K 3D Vectors  \t\t300-500K\t800-1000K\t1300-1400K 3D Triangles,  \t200-500K\t600-1000K\t1000-1200K 3D Triangles,  \t100-200K\t300-400K\t500-600K    10 pixel, flat shaded, connected   10 pixel, Gouraud shaded, connected   10 pixel, 2-pixel wide, anti-aliased, connected   50-pixel, Gouraud shaded, Z-buffered, strip   50-pixel, texture mapped, persp., point sampled  IMAGE PROCESSING  Cine loop - 8-bit\t15-36Mp/s\t37-58 Mp/s\t60-68 Mp/s Cine loop - 16-bit\t14 Mp/s\t\t25 Mp/s\t\t38 Mp/s Cine loop - 24-bit\t12-21 Mp/s\t21 Mp/s\t\t21 Mp/s Contrast stretching  \t14 Mp/s\t\t25 Mp/s\t\t20 Mp/s Bilinear zoom\t\t6 Mp/s\t\t11 Mp/s\t\t20 Mp/s Trilinear interp \t--\t\t6 Mvoxels/s\t11 Mvoxels/s    Lookup table -- 12-,16-bit to 8   Trilinear interpolation, 8-bit voxels  CONFIGURATIONS Frame Buffer Modules\t5\t\t10\t\t20 Transform Engine Mod.\t1-3\t\t3-5\t\t5-6   As you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part is the pricing.  I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information. Their number is 408-727-8100.  i am sure they will send you an information you may want.  Oh, some prices:  Low-end  Kenai 3400, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 27,795 dollars U.S. Kenai 3500, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 45,345 dollars U.S.  High-end  Kenai 3400, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 61,795 dollars U.S. Kenai 3500, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 79,345 dollars U.S.  If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or something I would appreciate it.  Hope this helps someone out there,  Brian  PS I am not affiliated with Kubota in any way.  Hell, I thought they made tractors or something. :-)
