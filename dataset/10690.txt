With the following logical consequences \t(a) Using any code designed to obscure informatio which is  \t    not easily breakable will be illegal, including \t\t(i) Using code words such as ``Project P5\'\' \t\t(ii) Speaking a language other than English \t\t(iii) Ever refering implicitly to events not known to \t\t\teveryone, eg \t\t\t Hi John. How was last night?  \t\t      For all the listener knows, this may be a code for \t\t\t Did you pick up the drugs OK last night?  \t\t      of be a code for \t\t         OK. We blow up the Pentagon at midnight.  \t\t(iv) Mentioning anything that could not be perfectly \t\t     understood by an average person with no education. \t\t(v) Words with more than one syllable. \t\t(vi) Speaking with a heavy accent that could bemisunderstood \t\t     by people not used to it. \t\t(vii) books with an  Inner meaning ...such \t\t      as  Animal Farm .  >(As an aside, is not the language here jarring?

I have a wonderful encrypter you can borrow that converts a message eg  Meet me at 11:30 to bomb the White House. Bring some dynamite  to an apparently (relatively) innoculous message. This message here is an example of the output for the above message :-).  >it is shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.  It is shockiong that it could happen anywhere. It is shocking that it could happen in a country  that has the arrogance to call itself free.  What you can do: \t(1) Write to your congress person in plain text. \t(2) Write to your congress person in encrypted text. \t\t(decrypter optional) \t(3) Send some random keystroked to your congressperson \t(4) Send some random keystrokes accross the US boundaries, \t\tand keep the spooks busy trying to decode it. \t(5) Write your own encryption algorithms. \t(6) do not buy clipper products.  P.S. I cannot work out why the US government does not want to sell them overseas. After all, they are rather easy for US interests to decode, so make a perfect tool for industrial/military espionage...lulling  anyone stupid enough to buy it into a false sense of security. You will notice that there is NO mention anywhere about safety for non-Americans.  Disclaimer: My opinions are mine alone, and do not represent anyone elses. I have nothing that I particularly want to hide at the moment...though I  consider the right to be able to use whatever method of coding data I like to be high on my list of priorities.  --  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Conway    arc@leland.stanford.edu  Phone: USA 415 497 1094
