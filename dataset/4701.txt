In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named \'build\'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is \'prog.c\'.  The resulting file must follow rule  2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set \'fix\' in the  X\t  ---entry--- section to \'n\'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X\t  Email message to the judges. X X\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X\t  \'y\' was given to the respective author is \'anon\' line. X X\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X\t* The entry is remarks should include: X\t    - what this program does X\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any X\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X\t    - information about any ---data--- files X\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated X\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X\t* Do not rot13 your entry is remarks.  You may suggest that certain X\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X\t  should not be required to exist. X X\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X\t   \'build\' is incorporated into a makefile, and \'build\' is removed X\t   \'prog.c\' is renamed to your entry is title, followed by an optional X\t       digit, followed by \'.c\' X\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry is X\t       title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry is remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the \'build\' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry is title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by \'.sh\'. X X       If needed, your entry is remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry is remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X\t\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X\t\tobfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject \'ioccc entry\'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.   X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user, X       special owner or group) are not allowed.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be \'old\' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X\t* look at the original source X\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \' include\' lines X\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \' define\' and \' include\' lines X\t* run it through a C beautifier X\t* examine the algorithm X\t* lint it X\t* compile it X\t* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    \'cleaned up\' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X     istrangest/most creative source layout\' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award \'worst abuse of the X    rules\' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award \'worst abuse of the rules\' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they did not work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting  this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake  would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of  defines to obscure the source has become \'old\'.  We X    tend to  isee thru\' masses of  defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing  defines or -Dfoo=bar will not go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X\t define d define X\t d foo\t\t   , use  instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives ( define,  if,  ifdef, ...), X    the leading \' \' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading \' \', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X\t* are very hardware specific X\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific X\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X\t      code is likely not to be) X\t* dump core or have compiler warnings X\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the \'remark\' header item) X\t* will not compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X\t* are longer than they need to be X\t* are similar to previous winners X\t* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    \'best one liner\' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D is to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D is in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the  ismallest self-replicating\' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of  ismallest\', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  do not X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, do not depend X    on color or a given size.  do not require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    do not use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X\t* are as concise and small as they need to be X\t* do something at least quasi-interesting X\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X\t* are portable X\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs cannot excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program does not have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the X\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X\tcontest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:\t1993 Xfix:\tn Xtitle:\tchonglab Xentry:\t0 Xdate:\tMon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:\tUn*x v6, pdp11/45 X\t2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as \'best\'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    \'best\' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc X\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books ( The New Hackers Dictionary ) and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for X\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.
