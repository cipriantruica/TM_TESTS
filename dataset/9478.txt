The Jim Abbott Trade.  bleagh! this was a terrific trade.  snow will certainly be better than mattingly in the future, but that they will be about the same now is a defensible opinion.  abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in the game today.  >2.  Wade Boggs.  i am not sure about this one.  i think that it is good, in that a pre-1992 boggs kicks hayes/meulens/whoevers\' ass, and that a 1992 boggs still is not ALL that shabby.  it is bad, though, that the yankees expect a pre-1992 boggs, and will probably get a 1992 boggs. however, i had still play boggs over hayes or bam bam.  >3.  Spike Owen.  you have my full agreement here.  he has not all that much better than velarde, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him. however, i do enjoy the fact that  spike  is not a nickname. not that this helps the yankees.  >4.  Danny Tartabull.  i strongly disagree.  i had much much rather have a hundred games of tartabull and sixty games of dion james than 162 games of james.   bob vesterman.
