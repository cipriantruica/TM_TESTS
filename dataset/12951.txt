From: todamhyp@charles.unlv.edu (Brian M. Huey) Subject: Krillean Photography  I think that is the correct spelling.. \tI am looking for any information/supplies that will allow do-it-yourselfers to take Krillean Pictures. i am thinking that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for sale, but I do not know any of the companies. Any info is greatly appreciated. \tIn case you do not know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.   --  _\x08D_\x08I_\x08S_\x08C_\x08L_\x08A_\x08I_\x08M_\x08E_\x08R_\x08: I can neither confirm nor deny any opinions expressed in this article directly reflect my own personal or political views and furthermore, if they did, I would not be at liberty to yield such an explanation of these alleged opinions.
