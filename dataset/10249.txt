Two points, one what does r.s.b.c. have to do with hockey?  Secondly, UMASS beat my Quakers???  Hello!!!  Earth here, are you responding???  we are not in the Atlantic 10 (or 8 whatever you wanna call it), we are in the Big 10 now!!! The A-10 was too weak for my Lady Lions -- they had to go to a more challenging conference.  It did not pay off as the Big East showed them a thing or too, but I still posted on a regular basis and tracked all the women is scores with reviews throughout the tournament.  It was not a reason to stop posting. :-)  >BTW.  Congratulations should go to the Sabres.  They are playing more  it is not over yet -- if anyone has a chance to come back in 4 games, I think Boston can do it, but I still see Buffalo winning in 6.  >diciplined, and with more will to win.

Never never never!)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Robbie Po **          1993 is STREAKERS    We do what comes naturally!
