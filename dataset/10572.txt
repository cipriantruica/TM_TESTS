I do not feel like I have to defend this team anymore.   The Devils are a puzzle to me.  They have long been one of the few teams I always dreaded playing.  Their D is not quite what it used to be but they still usually play us pretty tough.  I just cannot figure it out.  At least last night they mounted an attack.  >\t2.

Bernie Nichols was interviewed after Game 2 on the late news.  He was shaking his head in disbelief over Barrasso, saying that Tommy is like another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him. Then he got this far-away look on his face, his voice started trailing off and he said,  It just is not right...it just is not fair...  and he tried to muster a smile.  >i am really impressed with Bowman is coaching tactics - he has had an answer for >every move that Brooks has thrown at the Pens.  As far as coaching goes, a Pens/Islanders match-up should be pretty good.  One guy I feel sorry for in all of this so far is Chris Terreri.  i am sure Tom Barrasso knows how he feels.  For so long Tommy would look up and not have a teammate in sight.  Terreri is teammates really left him out in the cold in the first two games.  Mom.
