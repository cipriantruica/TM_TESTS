Actually, the phosphor ISN\'T usually anything special at all; what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor, which becomes charged as the electron beam intially  writes  the trace. With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level  flood  electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor which are next to the  written  areas on the storage screen.  There are some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage tube, and the stored trace tends to  bloom  with time.   Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a frame-buffer memory anyways.  > / Filip  i shall buy a vowel  Gieszczykiewicz. | Best e-mail  fmgst+@pitt.edu               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Ah, yes - from the same people who brought you that amazing new reading program that is sweeping Eastern Europe:  Hooked on Consonants!  :-)   Bob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not                    Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any other myers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.
