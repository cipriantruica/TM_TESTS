I re-read what I wrote and it did not say exactly what I thought.    Sure the Pens are a better team.  they have got size and the best skill players in the league.  they have also got the best clutch goaltending.  they are the  best team in the league.  But, my point was the Caps have not played to their ability level vs the Pens since last year is choke.  And that is the mental problem (the one they have had for a number of years) I tried to point out.  Spirit, mental preparedness, will to win, whatever you want to call it, it is missing when the Caps play the Pens.  Actually, you are right - it will not make any difference.  George
