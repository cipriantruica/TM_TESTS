From: jhan@debra.dgbt.doc.ca (Jerry Han) Subject: Overreacting (was Re: Once tapped, your code is no good any more)  In this giant bally-ho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather disturbing trend in some of the E-mail and posts i have tossing back and forth.    Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.  The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot?  In a new Civil War?   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and i am worried that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens and paper.    Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic (or Democratic style) governments.  I think you shall only find one in over five thousand years of written history.  that is not very good odds.    Somebody once said something like:  Armed Violence is meant only to be used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder.   let us try to avoid killing things, eh?  there is enough blood shed in the world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.  i am probably overreacting.  But what i have read scared me a lot.  I do not want my children growing up in a War Zone.   --  Jerry Han-CRC-DOC-Div. of Behavioural Research- jhan@debra.dgbt.doc.ca  ///////////// These are my opinions, and my opinions only.
