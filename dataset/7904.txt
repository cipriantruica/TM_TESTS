The dog needed assistance straightening out once on board. The owner would lift the front legs of dog and throw them over the driver/pilots shoulders. Said dog would get shit eating grin on its face and away they would go. The dogs ass was firmly planted on the seat.    My dog and this dog actively seek each other out at camping party is. They hate each other. I think it is something personal.   ================================================================================  Steatopygias is \'R\' Us.          doh#0000000005 That am not no Hottentot.
