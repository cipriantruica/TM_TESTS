Rich, \tFirst of all you might want to join the VetteNet (vettes@chiller.compaq \t.com)  during your search/acquisition of the 67.  $20k sounds about  \tright for a wrong engine, condition 3 car.  This means that the car may \tnot have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver \tand or hobby car.  You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette \tBlack Book immediately.  do not leave home (to look at Vettes) without it. \tSince you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a \tfew hours in reading the  Corvette Buyer is Guide  and purchase Noland \tAdams\' tape  How to Buy a Corvette.   The tape shows you how to check \tfor damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect the \tvalue, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  The \tlist is much too long to go into here.  Join the VetteNet where \tthere are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage \tvettes) that are available to help you.  The pubs I mentioned above \tare available from Mid-America Designs (800) 637-5533 and several \tother Corvette parts sources.  Good luck!!! \t \tTom   (\'68 327/350hp - \'79 Cruiser)
