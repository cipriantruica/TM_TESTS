My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.  Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time.  Here is an example.  For some time, I was short of  free interrupts.   I had a tape controller (not a  floppy tape ) that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (it is an *old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would most likely  hang. )  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler will not do anything for the serial port.  Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. that is why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7. Try that on NT and see how far you shall get. :-) --  Kenneth R.
