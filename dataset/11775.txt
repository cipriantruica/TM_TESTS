From: ali@cns.nyu.edu (Alan Macaluso) Subject: MICROPHONE PRE-AMP/LOW NOISE/PHANTOM POWERED  i am looking to build a microphone preamp that has very good low-noise characteristics,  large clean gain, and incorportates phantom power (20-48 volts (dc)) for a PZM microphone.  i am leaning towards a good, low-cost (??) instrumentation amplifier to maintain the balanced input from the microphone, for its good CMRR, internal compensation, and because i can use a minimal   of parts.    Does anyone out there have any experience, suggestions, advice, etc...that they would like to pass on, i had greatly appreciate it.   --- A l a n  M a c a l u s o\t\t \tPURPLE MOON GIANTS ali@cns.nyu.edu  \t\t\t\t158 E. 7th.
