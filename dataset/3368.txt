After leaving F-15 III it would, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive A:.  This has been fixed.  I do not know what other corrections were made.  2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things do not work.  3) Download glb05.exe.  Format a bootable floppy disk, and do not put a config.sys or autoexec.bat.  Run the self extracting archive so all the files explode to the disk.  Run the file fsh.exe.  It should be self-explanatory from there.  Dan  P.S.:  I was feeling extraordinarily generous once again, so I uploaded the file to ftp.cica.indiana too..  --  Daniel Matthew Coleman\t\t   |   Internet: dcoleman@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu -----------------------------------+---------- : dcoleman@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu The University of Texas at Austin  |\t DECnet: UTXVMS::DCOLEMAN Electrical/Computer Engineering\t   |\t BITNET: DCOLEMAN@UTXVMS [.BITNET]
