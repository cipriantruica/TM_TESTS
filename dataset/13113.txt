Subject: good book From: RGINZBERG@eagle.wesleyan.edu (Ruth Ginzberg)  Having been gone for 10 days, i am way behind on my News reading, so many pardons if I am repeating something that has been said already.  I read a good book while I was away, THE ANTIBIOTIC PARADOX: HOW MIRACLE DRUGS ARE DESTROYING THE MIRACLE, Stuart B. Levy, M.D., 1992, Plenum Press, ISBN:0-306-44331-7.  It is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.  It is interesting & written at a level which I think many sci.med readers would appreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of understanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed to this particular information. I.e., it assumes you are smart enough to understand it, but it does not assume that you already have a degree in microbiology or medicine. Table of contents:  Chapter 1 \tFrom Tragedy the Antibiotic Age is Born Chapter 2 \tThe Disease and the Cure:  The Microscopic World of Bacteria and \tAntibiotics Chapter 3 \tReliance on Medicine and Self-Medication: The Seeds of Antibiotic \tMisuse Chapter 4 \tAntibiotic Resistance:  Microbial Adaptation and Evolution Chapter 5 \tThe Antibiotic Myth Chapter 6 \tAntibiotics, Animals and the Resistance Gene Pool Chapter 7 \tFurther Ecological Considerations:  Antibiotic Use in Agriculture, \tAquaculture, Pets, and Minor Animal Species Chapter 8 \tFuture Prospects:  New Advances Against Potential Disaster Chapter 9 \tThe Individual and Antibiotic Resistance Chapter 10 \tAntibiotic Resistance: A Societal Issue at Local, National, and \tInternational Levels.  Includes bibliography and index.  I personally found that it made very good Airplane-Reading. -rg  ------------------------ Ruth Ginzberg  Philosophy Department;Wesleyan University;USA
