I cannot help it if everyone got all serious.  Ross.  \tI never saw your original posting.  it dropped on the floor somewhere.  I just saw the trickle down, thought it was intensely stupid,  not knowing anything about the joke, mentioned arbitron and left it with an equally stupid joke.  Bill in his ever increasing devotion to thoroughness dug up  several  arbitron stats.  I myself think the arbitron stats are  severely methodologically impaired, but are a good measure of proportion.  I do not think anyone knows how many people read news anymore.  pat
