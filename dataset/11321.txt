There are millions of Macintosh users who    have no idea what is in Apple is patented ROMs. Many have modems connected.    How do you know all your business secrets are not being stolen? Answer:    1. Because you trust Apple;    2. Because if any such attempt, however sophicsticated, came out, it would    destroy Apple is credibility forever.  Then there is also 3) Because it is NOT SECRET.  If I want to, I CAN go look at Apple is copyrighted ROMs in a Mac, so they are not keeping any secrets.   You do not even have to pry the top off the chip and use an electron microscope, you just have to read the data in memory and see if you can figure out what it means. (Motorola object code is not all *that* obscure!)   Yes, it is copyrighted, so I cannot go selling copies, or using the copy myself, but I CAN see it, and disassemble it.  4) they are not asking me to trust their honesty.  they are asking me to trust the quality of their assembly language programming :-), but I can see for myself what the performance, price, and crashes/day are. NSA, an organization not known for its honesty or openness,  is asking me to trust them with my privacy, but they will not trust me.
