Yes, but the extra encryption could be applied *before* the message is encrypted by the Clipper, so that the wrapper would be fine, the phone is serial number and the session key would be in the law-enforcement field, etc., but the message would not be readable even if the particular Clipper is key were obtained from the escrow agents.  In fact, it should not even be possible to detect that a message has been double-encrypted without a court order, right?
