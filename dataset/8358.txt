Trash was everywhere - reason? Not enough dipsy dumpsters for the massive crowd. Oatman was not prepared for the vast number of PEOPLE that showed up.  BTW Michael, Oatman is the RIGHT PLACE & TIME. it is called a RUN! Maybe you did not read my comment that  They loved us  and i am talking about the merchants and townspeople. The merchants that did not want us - their shops were closed.   Maybe I should have mentioned that when I left - the trash was being picked up (aluminum sells) by a crew assigned to the task.   I think the bottom line here is do they want us back ???!!! They Do! This \'action\' that went on at Oatman is TYPICAL on a predominatly Harley run. it is innocent fun.   So since I enjoy TYPICAL Harley fun at Runs - in your eyes that makes me an asshole. i have already admitted i am an asshole many times on the net. All my friends are assholes too (lyrics to a new song?). So, you want a dime to call someone that cares?   It appears we have a difference of opinion. Maybe you should look at the big picture before you pass judgement on others. 11th Annual. That should tell you something.                            Lynn Hall - NOS Bros
