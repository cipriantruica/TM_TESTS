My problem is,  I do not like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer, try: \txwdtopnm  |\t  convert to PPM \t[ppmtopgm |]\t\t  .. to graylevel for smaller file to print \tpnmtops -noturn |\t  .. to PostScript \tlpr\t\t\t  print  pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4  wide, use: \tpnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it \tis high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a \twidth less than 4 , and will thus be printed smaller than 4  wide. \tIf you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4 , and \twill be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified \tpaper width.  \tIn short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size, \tbut it will not blow it up automatically.  Hope this helps.
