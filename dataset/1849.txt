From: bwana@daktari.Corp.Sun.COM (Don Finch) Subject: Windows 3.1 and IMF Boards ?    I am interested to know if there is know procedure/document to configure an IBM Musci Feature (IMF) card to work as the sound device with MS-Windows 3.1.  I believe the IMF uses the same FM synth chip as the Soun Blaster, but did not know what driver to use or how to configure the MIDI-mapper.  Any help, past success, suggestions?  Thanks,  Don.  ==============================================================================         / \t\t\t\t            \t\t\t\t|\tDonald Finch            /        /   | | |  |\t|\t           / /           | | |  |\t|\tTechnical Support Engr.\t      /  /  / /          | | |  |\t|\tN.
