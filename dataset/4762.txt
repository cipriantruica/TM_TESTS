From: swick@news.Colorado.EDU (Ross Swick) Subject: Books on I.C.C other than I.C.C.M.  Can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications BESIDES I.C.C.M.?  i have looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it but nobody SHOWS you how.  O\'Reilly has no examples, ICCM has no examples, Asente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books i have looked at, if they discuss ICC at all, simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and then refer you to the ICCM.  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and  Properties in Young is book and five hours after I bought Young is book I had my applications talking to each other.  I am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  i had like to stay independent  of Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably are not the way to go.  But within X one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups.  I need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best for which purpose, and gives examples.  Without examples it is all just words.  Thanks in advance  Ross
