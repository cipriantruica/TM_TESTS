The big win with the V-1 is not its range but rather its directionality and multiple-transmitter tracking (which you later called a  gimmick  -- a conclusion I disagree with).  Since the detector incorporates multiple receivers it is not surprising that it is significantly more expensive.  While the added capabilities may not help you, there is added value for those of us who live in areas where there are a lot of false-alarms.  >Summary: Valentine-1 way too expensive and not a significantly better >performer!  I certainly call it  interesting  but i am another person who thinks that the added value might be coming at too high a cost.  Very adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and one of them has suited me rather well.  If I did more long-distance travelling in areas i am not familiar with i had probably consider getting the V-1 because it is additional information would be useful in discriminating false alarms.  jim frost jimf@centerline.com
