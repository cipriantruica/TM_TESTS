From: dpiaseck@jarthur.claremont.edu (Derek A. Piasecki) Subject: Re: Ami Pro 3.0 and PCTools compress?!? does not like being moved?   Sorry about that - do not want to alarm anyone...  I do not think there is any correlation between the crashes and PCTools. I reinstalled Ami Pro, and ran compress again, with no problems. I think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had 0 bytes (!) left while FTPing, although I would think it would not matter since Ami Pro was not running at the time, and I made space available immediately anyways. But, whatever, the cause, it is working now.  \t\t\t\t-Derek
