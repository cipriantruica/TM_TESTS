Anyone who dies for a  cause  runs the risk of dying for a lie.  As for people being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we have had grifters and charlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield had been the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.   Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he was not the first to be  witnessed.   What sets him apart?  >\tNiether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  >to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  >anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see  >this right away.  Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and  megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini, Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century. Koresh is a non-issue.   >\tTherefore since he was not a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  >real thing.    Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in your logic everywhere.  And as i am sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!   >\tSome other things to note.

Just because something is written in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plus the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if you do quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with  supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.   >\tI do not think most people understand what a Christian is.  It  >is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.

I do not know how you  define the world  total,  but I would imagine a  total sacrafice [sp] of everything for God is sake  would involve more than a time commitment.  You are correct about our tendency to  box everything into time units.  Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe) television? --  ---                      __  _______                              --- ||| Kevin Marshall          / /_  _/  Computer Science Department ||| ||| Virginia Tech            / / /     marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu ||| --- Blacksburg, Virginia    / /_/                  (703) 232-6529 ---
