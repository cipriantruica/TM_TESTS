Would they be        What kind of brainless clod does not understand the difference       between a  PROPOSED BILL, BLOCKED IN CONGRESS  and an  EXECUTIVE      ORDER, ISSUED BY CLINTON, AND CRAMMED DOWN OUR THROATS .          Here, let me give a remedial course in thinking:       In order to create the appearance of low interest rates, Uncle Sam      has shifted his debt from long-term to short-term securities.       In effect, Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into      one giant S&L, waiting to blow.       Short-term rates rise --->  Interest payments on Deficit rise --->      Uncle Sammy has to borrow more ---->  Causing Short-term rates to rise.       Uncle Sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop.  His options:         i) Raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount        ii)  Make truly unimaginable spending cuts      Results of i):  large numbers of pissed-off citizens     Results of ii): large numbers of pissed-off citizens       Uncle Sammy has thoughtfully taken the initiative to pre-empt the use     of communication newtworks to foster a nation-wide, grassroots     uprising.
