Secondly, I would not expect them to love me simply because   they were my creator.  I would expect to have to earn that love.  >The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward >Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.    Are you daft?  How do I love something I do not believe exists?

At which point you have stepped over the line and become a   complete asshole.  Even though it is your first offense, I will not   let it slip becuase i have heard it too goddamned many times.    You love Jesus because deep in your heart you are a cannibalistic   necrophiliac.  Because I say so, and i am much more qualified to   assess your motivations than you are.    Fortunately, there are some things I get to accept on evidence   rather than faith.  One of them being that until christians like   yourself quit being so fucking arrogant, there will never be   peace.  you have all made sure of that.  / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /    Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
