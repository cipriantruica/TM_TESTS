Emphasis of what? >  > Nitpicking and scolding is a whiney debating style, Jim. >   No, you just miss the point.  By your methods, I can prove gun control to be a   total failure.  New York is total homocide count, with it is strict gun control,   is MUCH higher than Rhode Island is, with it is less strict gun control.  FAR   more folks are killed in New York, than Rhode Island.  Therefore, according to   Mane Logic(tm), gun control has made New York a much more dangerous place than   Rhode Island.  Remember, it is  Nitpicking  and  a whiney debating style  to   point out the differences between New York and Rhode Island that might defeat   my argument.  > : Anything else is blowing smoke. >  > You seddit, brudda.
