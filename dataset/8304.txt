From: pubs1@plx.com (Temporary Technical Writer) Subject: Re: Need advice for riding with someone on pillion  Because riding a passenger does not really depend on the type of bike. The things you want a passenger to do/not do is the same.  Ergo, if he has asking advice, I reasoned he does not have much practice, period.  If you say he does, fine.  I still would not take the uninitiated up a road that is all switch backs and reverse/center/uncrowned roadway, not to mention the BDCs and squids who will also be on that particular road.  He asked for advice, and even though it was not what he meant, I still consider it some of the best i have read.   Lee
