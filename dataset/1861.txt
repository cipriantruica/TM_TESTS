Hi,       i have been using Plannet Crafter is  Plug-in  for Program Manager.       Its listed in most BBS\'es as PLUGIN13.  Its an add-on which gives       some needed features to Progman; such as the ability to better       manage your groups, change your cursor and icons on the fly,       constant status of RAM and resources,  Quick-menu  (a drop-down       menu of DOS commands or app launcher), plus some other neat stuff.       Used it, liked it, and even reg had it .        If you cannot find it anywhere, let me know and i shall zip it up and       mail it to you (shareware version, of course ...)  Aloha... ---  .. .es ..
