From: monet@carson.u.washington.edu (Diana Smith) Subject: Borgward question   My ex-husband & I used to own Borgwards.  have not seen any for a long time.  They were really good cars.  Does ayone out there know anything about them now?  I heard they were being made in Mexico, but of course they would not be the original German - if that is even true.  When i have been in Mexico I have not seen any.  We loved ours, even tho\' they were ugly - they had names - one was Humphrey Borgward.
