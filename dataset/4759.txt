You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.  You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.  Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit()  regularly.
