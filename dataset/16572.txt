We can just call them house Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.  \tI think  house Jews,  a reference to a person of Jewish ancestry who issues statements for a company or organization that condemn Judaism is perfectly sufficeint.  I think a few years free of their anti-Semetic role models would do wonders for most of them.
