From: jge@cs.unc.edu (John Eyles) Subject: diet for Crohn is (IBD)   A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohn is disease.  But she cannot seem to eat certain foods, such as fresh vegetables, without discomfort, and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence.  Her question is: are there any nutritionists who specialize in the problems of people with Crohn is disease ?  (I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric).  Thanks in advance, John Eyles jge@cs.unc.edu
