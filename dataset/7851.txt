This is pretty damned complicated. I just make a  back off  motion with my hand/arm, and the second or third time even the most braindead cager backs off. If they do not back off then, I find a way to get the hell out of there -- the cager is either psychotic, drunk, or just a complete asshole. In any case, I do not want to be anywhere near, and especially not in front. --  Curtis Jackson\t   cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com\t\'91 Hawk GT\t\'81 Maxim 650 DoD#0721 KotB  \'91 Black Lab mix  Studley Doright   \'92 Collie/Golden  George   There is no justification for taking away individuals\' freedom  in the guise of public safety.  -- Thomas Jefferson
