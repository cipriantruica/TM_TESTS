From: ceng@mdd.comm.mot.com (Curtis Eng) Subject: Selling a car through a car hunter  Anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of those car hunters?  i am selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T and I was contacted by this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois.    They said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they would not be talking to me.  They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything about my car and said they could sell it no problem.  They guaranteed that if they did not sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and since I charged it, i am protected by federal law which states that if i am not satisfied, I would get a refund (which is true).  They federal expressed all the paperwork  to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.  I called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is good news.  So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it is been over week and I have gotten nothing.  So how effective are these types of  companies? Anybody care to share their experiences?
