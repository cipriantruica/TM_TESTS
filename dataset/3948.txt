From: Ravi Konchigeri  Subject: Re: LCIII problems  Finally got my computer fixed and i had like to sum up.  About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference?  Apparently! :)  Second, about hard drive position.  i have put the LCIII on its side and the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  i have even switched back and forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As far as i am concerned I do not believe HD position is important for drives up to 160 meg, in any computer.  do not know about CD-ROM, though.   \t Just like everything else in life, the right lane ends in half a mile.
