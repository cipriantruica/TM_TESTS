Utopia is a myth (although we can do a lot better than what we have today). But I think that you must pitch Libertarianism as a progressive agenda (ie You can do better under our style of system).  >>        I admire a lot of what the Libertarians stand for, but you >>guys are some of the worst salesmen I have ever seen.

Are you in?  i am flattered by your invitation, but i am afraid you have the wrong person. Although I completely agree with your civil liberties agenda, i am not  in support of your economic agenda. What I DO like about the Libertarian party is that you guys are so good at shaking up the tired ideas of the past. I encourage you guys to continue your crusade, but i am afraid I cannot ride along.  >  >>>Ian Sutherland >>>ian@eecs.nwu.edu >  >> Nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has          Garrett Johnson >> come.  --Tussman                                           Garrett@Ingres.com >  >/June  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has          Garrett Johnson  come.  --Tussman                                           Garrett@Ingres.com  The probability of someone watching you is proportional to the stupidity of your action.  - Unknown ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
