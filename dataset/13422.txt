There have been and always will be people who are blinded by their own  knowledge and unopen to anything that is not already established. Given what  the medical community does not know, i am surprised that he has this outlook.  For the record, I have had several outbreaks of thrush during the several  past few years, with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional  deficiencies. I had not taken any antobiotics.   My dentist (who sees a fair amount of thrush) recommended acidophilous:  After I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis, the outbreaks ceased. When I quit taking the acidophilous, the outbreaks periodically resumed.  I resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then.  * Mike McCurdy                        * University Computing Services     Disclaimer: * San Diego State University * mccurdy@ucsvax.sdsu.edu             Everything I say may be wrong
