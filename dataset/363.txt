So Mary comes up : with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.   :     Nice attempt Chris . . . verrry close.    You missed the conspiracy by 1 step. Joseph knew who knocked her up. He could not let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol\' Mary prego. That would not do well for his popularity in the local circles. So what  happened is that she was feeling guilty, he was feeling embarrassed, and THEY decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise been the downfall for both. Clever indeed. Come to think of it . . . I have gained a new respect for the couple. Maybe Joseph and Mary should receive all of the praise being paid to jesus.
