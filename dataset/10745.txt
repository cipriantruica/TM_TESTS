They do not have to track customer lists - they merely have to digitally listen to any phone line and eliminate any that do not have the clipper header/signature.  (No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet it is a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)  Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  i have seen them advertised in the trade press.  Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what is left is crypto worth looking more closely at.  I guess any substitute scheme will have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start looking at the data too...  Whatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private crypto stand out like a sore thumb.  G
