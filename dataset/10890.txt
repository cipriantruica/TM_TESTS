A typical example of seep-minded thinking. We all know that David Sternlight is a jerk, but i am afraid that in this case 90% of the population will think like him. Realize it guys - NSA, Dorothy Denning, and the US government have already won the battle...  Unless... unless you succeed to wake up the people... but nah, that is too unlikely... The events are happening too fast, cryptography is a too sophisticated issue, and almost nobody cares anyway... A few thousand of net.readers will not make the difference, if millions are caught asleep... Too sad... :-(((((  Regards, Vesselin --  Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev          Virus Test Center, University of Hamburg Tel.:+49-40-54715-224, Fax: +49-40-54715-226      Fachbereich Informatik - AGN  Vogt-Koelln-Strasse 30, rm. 107 C e-mail: bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de    D-2000 Hamburg 54, Germany
