Oh, but i am weary of trying to wade through Jim is repertoire of  red herrings and smoke screens.  let us see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today through the  hadiscord\' filter (a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont was kind enough to send me):  \tTaking action? A white geese be held \tas an accomplice to be held as \ta decision upon the door \tA black and white goose waddles past \tthe eyes of the door.  \tHits it with the confidence interval for  \tthat individual is held responsible  \tfor that, that individual  \tmay be held as a  \tgetaway car may be held  \tas an uncountably large number  \tof the driver of something  \tand agree.  \tA black goose  \twaddles past the person imprisoned?  \tWhite goose waddles past the  \tconfidence interval for the population  \tof geese be axed,  \tfine. \tAnd white goose  \twaddles past the door.  Does running Jim is articles through  hadiscord\' make them more coherent?  Less coherent?  Or has  hadiscord\' turned Jim is articles into an angst-ridden poem about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty, yet being held responsible for the choices we make?  Do the geese symbolize an inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be black and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the  getaway car  tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our being is not to  get away  from responsibility for our actions, but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the  driver  of the getaway car, as it were?  Does the juxtaposition of man and machine, car and driver, reveal a subtext: an internal conflict between determinism and moral responsibility?  Or am I reading too much into a collaboration between Jim and a random number generator?  dj
