From: Christopher Kristof  Subject: ??? Mystery Part ???      I have a mystery part labeled NEC AC100.  it is from the low voltage supply of an NEC Multisync I monitor.  it is a three lead part in a square package like a volate regulator or power transistor.  The board is labeled CR691 where the part goes.  (Possibly an SCR?)  The pin labeled G on the board goes to a zener diode (reference voltage?); the pin labeled T1 goes to the negative lead of a capacitor in the power supply, and the pin labeled T2 goes to the negative side of the bridge rectifier in the supply.      If anyone can tell me what this is, or better yet, where I can buy one just like it, please email me at ck3i@andrew.cmu.edu.  i have called NEC is  monitor repair number  and not only do they not know what the part is, but they do not think that they can find one to sell to me...  It makes no sense to me...  Thanks
