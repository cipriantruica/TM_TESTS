I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where I purchased the car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  The second time, after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing list (they said they did not know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and made it *much* better.  However it now makes a  scritch scritch  noise on rough roads, and *still* squeals when I open/close the window in wet weather (anyone elses is do this?)  >>Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C\'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!  I got two keys with my car, but only ONE remote-entry push-button thingie! But then, I bought my 93 with 2500 miles, and  I think it may have been a repossession ... so i am not surprised something was missing :-(  >>horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)  I am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where it describes the procedure to follow if  you discover something on your Ford that could ... cause ... serious injury ... threaten lives ... etc).  Something about notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford.  Those little  you have-got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep  buttons are TERRIBLE. > >The latter is probably because of the air bag.  it is pretty much takes up >all the space where you had expect to find the horn. >Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one >of those nice \'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind. >The previous Probes had Japanese horns.  Well, I guess that is good in a way, but in a way it is bad.  When someone hears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big American car.  They may not associate the sound with a small  jap car  style car (like the Probe is).  >>Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car  >Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.  The mudflaps help a lot.  >>transmission (the 5 speed is a must)  I have always been a 5-speed guy.  Almost every car i have ever owned has been a 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I (knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty high-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with torque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, i am getting 35 mpg on the highway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I  probably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been around 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it does not have the  control  of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out to be very convenient.  it is nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in   we-like-to-control-your-life Massachusetts  :-)   >>No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)  Shakes and rattles has been my main gripe.  i have gotten them to fix the worst of them, but I fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older.  >>Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  On my 89 Probe GL, I got about 40K out of the original Goodyears, and had driven the replacement tires (Bridgestone) 50K miles when I tradeed the car.  The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe look like they are designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow tread, etc), so they probably will not last as long.  But the car handles very very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough surface.  >interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically >sound.  Definitely.  Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  The car has a  much more expensive than it actually is  look and feel to it.  >Yes, this car is stiff suspension is not for everyone.  I personally like it, >but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, i had strongly >suggest looking into the MX-6.  Having driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension  interesting . The car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.  >>If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  they will find >>that they have no room in the back and you shall find that the car rides >>differently (if that is  better  is up to you).    Well I would not encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As mentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups,  consider the back seat as a parcel shelf .  No biggie to me though (if it had been, i had not have bought the car!  (but it is definitely not a family car)).  >>Also, there is a lot of glass >>around you which I was not expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty >>hot in the summer.  A/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93.  The 93 in particular sends out a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX.  That  lots of glass  you mentioned is what gives the car the  very good visibility  reports you see in all the write-ups.  Most  sports/sporty  cars do not have that good visibility.  >>i have heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. >I have not heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes >(\'89 and maybe \'90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which  The complaints i have heard re: exhaust system (on 93 is) have been on  the GT.  Of course being a different engine, that is a differeent  exhaust system.  I was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement. Since I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice,  I was/am due a refund from Ford.  I applied in February and am Still waiting.   :-(  >gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my >car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering >that I was expecting the worst from them!  Yes.  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touch-up adjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy for them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  They  did make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(  >From what i have heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with  >the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but  >I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  that is >almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.  I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm.  But I seriously feel the car design is sound, and expect it to do very well.  --  Bill Heiser    heiser@acs.bu.edu, heiser@world.std.com                Boston University, Boston MA
