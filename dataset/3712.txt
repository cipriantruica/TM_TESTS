From: morgan@dl5000.bc.edu (Morgan Stair) Subject: Writing EMM driver  i am writing a driver that needs to remap some I/O ports.  This means virtual mode.  Unfortunately virtual mode means it will not get along with expanded memory managers, so I need make it an EMM driver too.  Does anyone out there have EMM code.  Can any point me to an EMM code source?  -Thanks, Morgan --
