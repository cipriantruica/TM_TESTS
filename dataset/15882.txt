One more time.  It am not about duck hunting.  It am not about lone perps on lonely streets.  it is about DEFENDING OUR RIGHTS from the *GOVERNMENT*, which  has seen fit to ignore history and attempt once again to take them from us.  They WILL SUCCEED if we do not do something NOW.  that is why I think the NRA is a bunch of WEENIES, because they have FORGOTTEN that fundamental fact.  Pardon all my shouting, but there seem to be a whole helluva lot of people on Condition White, fat, dumb, and happy, sucking that glass teat for all they are worth.... Wake up and smell the cordite, gang, they are shooting at us, and it is high time we shot back, at least with our keyboards.....   my two bits\'  Glenn R. Stone (glenns@eas.gatech.edu) fly your flags at half staff and upside down, to mourn and protest the death of the BoR.
