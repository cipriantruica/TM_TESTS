Most all from Audio >Control have them I know the C-101 does.      With regards to what you wrote, how does one  adjust for room dynamics  and stuff like that ?  I asked a professor that question just last week and he did not really know himself.  Since pink noise is believed to be due to surface states (say, the surface of the Silicon where there is a lack of a covalent bond) that act as  traps  to nearby elecrons, and since this happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they are not able to  trap  electrons), how do you compensate for that?  It seems to me that you would not be able to compensate for pink noise.  I have seen the  pink noise  feature, however, on many EQs, and I was wondering how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to  man made noise  like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc.  If you have any information about this, it would be appreciated.  Hope this did not sound too drawn out.  Thanx.                                 - David (shorty@helios.nevada.edu)
