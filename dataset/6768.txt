GM, at least, is heading in that direction.  One of the post-sale questions they asked me was if i had like the choice of a cigarette liter or an accessory plug, and another whether i had like the choice of an ashtray or a cup holder.  The \'93 Geo Storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option (which did not exist in the \'92 I bought) -- i am not sure about the ash tray vs cup holder.  it is a step in the right direction.  The ashtray does make a convenient change-holder so it is not completely useless.  jim frost jimf@centerline.com
