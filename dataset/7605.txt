From: SKUKRETI@CHEMICAL.watstar.uwaterloo.ca (Sanjai Kukreti) Subject: Advice on used car?  Hi, I was looking for some helpful advice. i am a university student with about $7000 to spend, and i am looking for a  used car. Does anyone have any useful advice they could offer to a first- time buyer? i am not looking for anything sporty, just something functional  and reliable (less maintenance costs). Anybody have any ideas on what models  might suit me?  Thanks  Sanjai
