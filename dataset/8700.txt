Still, the man  actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this year did not pitch in the majors last year.  Huh?  IMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the  other expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues. In Gammons\' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some increase will be seen.  He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season.  he has still full of it...   --              Kurt Bose (as in Daisy, not Rose) * kbos@carina.unm.edu  If you take out all the f--ks, this is an 18 page book.     -Wally Backman, leafing though a copy of Mets teammate Lenny Dykstra is      autobiography, _NAILS_
