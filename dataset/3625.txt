From: dvs@ze8.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de (Wolfgang R. Mueller) Subject: [Q] Internal modems without uart ?  Seeing all these questions about uart types, their availability, and their relative merits, would not it be fine, if for internal highspeed modems there were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and instead accessing directly the relatively large send/receive buffers of the   modem, thus eliminating all problems with interrupt latencies ? Just an idea, Wolfgang R. Mueller , Computing Centre, Heinrich-Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany.
