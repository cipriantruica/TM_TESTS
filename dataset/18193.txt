I cannot really speak for Mr. Cramer here, but I can say that a    homosexual [male] is an entirely different animal than a lesbian.    There is virtually nothing that is analogous or related between the    aberrant behaviors practiced by these two groups of deviants.      So it has nothing to do with your morals, its just that you would not   have anything to wack off to if you did not have tapes of Lesbians   going at it....      I think we are getting closer to the truth now.  No, we are getting at Mr. Foard is sickness.  This may surprise homosexuals, but lots of people in this country do NOT spend their time watching pornography and masturbating.  Some of us have  real lives, instead of sexual compulsions.  But I do not expect a homosexual to understand that. --  Clayton E. Cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer  My opinions, all mine! Relations between people to be by mutual consent, or not at all.
