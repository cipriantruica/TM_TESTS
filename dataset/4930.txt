From: dyoung@media.mit.edu (David Young) Subject: Drawing Lines (inverse/xor)  i am trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band boxes in Motif/X.  i am running on an 8-bit display for which i have created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which i am displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If does not matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed.  Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:     /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */    /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */    palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;    palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;    palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;    XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);    XFlush( myDisplay);     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);    XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);  Then to draw I do:     XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);    XFlush( myDisplay);  And when i am all done, to return things to normal I do:     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);   What i had like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever i am drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  it is very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).  Any suggestions what i am doing wrong?  david
