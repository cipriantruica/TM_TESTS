I do not know where you live, but I could not get out of my driveway at night without reverse lights. As someone said, out in the country you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between day and night. At night around my house (which is amongst a forest of rather tall oaks) it is DARK, except for nights with full moons. Reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up; I greatly prefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights.  \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
