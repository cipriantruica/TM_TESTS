The problem with your approach is they add up what you can reasonably claim as  ispin-offs\', add up what is been spent on space, and then come back with something like,  You spent $X billion for that?  would not it be better just to spend the money on direct research and forget all this space stuff?  We could have got all that stuff a *lot* cheaper that way.  Space is wasteful and inefficient.   Then they cancel your funding and spend it studying mating rituals of New Guinea tribesmen or something.  --   Insisting on perfect safety is for people who do not have the balls to live  in the real world.    -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I do not speak for others and they do not speak for me.
