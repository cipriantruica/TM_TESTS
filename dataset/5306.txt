I do not have a problem with this.  John Bradley has put a *hell* of a lot of work into xv, and if he feels that it is time to get some monetary reward from it, that is surely his right.  > Can the author legally sell xv?  Xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed > by others.  Did the author get permission to sell these works?  Had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the IJG JPEG code (which are right there in the xv distribution), you would have observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware and commercial software.  Sam Leffler is libtiff copyright also grants permission for unrestricted use including resale.  > My guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author > maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product,   Commercial ?  there is a big difference between a polite request for a voluntary donation and commercial, it is-illegal-to-copy-this- and-we will-sic-our-lawyers-on-you software.  I do agree that John is readme file could be a little clearer about what he means by personal use.  \t\t\tregards, tom lane \t\t\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group
