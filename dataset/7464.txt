Subject: REVIEW: 1989 Ford Taurus SHO From: david.bonds@cutting.hou.tx.us (David Bonds)    GK>Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter GK>refuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to GK>get it into gear.  i shall be watching this carefully in the next couple GK>of months.  Enter 1st, wait 2-3 seconds and then go into reverse.  They use the same synchros, and you shall never (at least I have not) ground-em-to-fit when using this technique.                                                                                   ---- The Cutting Edge BBS (cutting.hou.tx.us)   A PCBoard 14.5a system Houston, Texas, USA   +1.713.466.1525          running uuPCB
