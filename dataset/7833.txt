From: erick@andr.UB.com (Eric A. Kilpatrick) Subject: Re: Drinking and Riding  Personally, I follow the no alcohol rule when i am on a bike.  My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike!  If I get hurt it is my own fault, but I do not want to wreck my Katana.  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*.  I had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00.  I was not even close to leagle intoxication, but I could not perform even the most basic things until 8:30!  This made     me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication.  You may seem fine, but your reactions may be affected such that you shall be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind.  I greatly enjoy social drinking but, for me, it just does not mix with riding.  Max enjoyment! Eric
