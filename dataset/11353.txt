From: gtoal@gtoal.com (Graham Toal) Subject: Re: let us build software cryptophones for over the internet...  I forwarded an old posting about CELP speech compression:  \tIn case you had like to experiment with CELP, you can obtain a software \timplementation of the 4800 bps Fed Std CELP coder for free:  \tThe U.S. DoD is Federal-Standard-1016 based 4800 bps code excited linear \tprediction voice coder version 3.2 (CELP 3.2) Fortran and C simulation source \tcodes are now available for worldwide distribution at no charge (on DOS \tdiskettes, but configured to compile on Sun SPARC stations) from:  i have since been told that the source of this is on cygnus.com in /pub/celp.speech.tar.Z  i am not in a position to; any Sun tcp/ip gurus out there who think they can marry this with netfone by the end of the week? ;-)  Seriously.  I think someone with real net access and two sparcs could have this running by the end of the week.  Then we ask the pgp guys to add a bytestream crypto filter.  Two weeks at the most.  [Damn, I wish I had my sparc back... i am stuck on a 25mhz 386sx]   Share and Enjoy!  G PS  you shall have to use archie to find netfone - I have a copy but no note of where it is from; author in the docs is kelvin@autodesk.com and he appears to be located in France
