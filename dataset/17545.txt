I would not worry too much about it, though.  We are starting to find out how politically impotent homosexuals really are.  The Colorado boycott has fizzled, Slick Willie was effectively prevented from implementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his _OWN_ party, this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their claims of large numbers, and coming this Saturday they are going to wind up with _TREMENDOUS_ egg on their face when, I submit, no more than perhaps 35,000 queers will show up in Washington while they are promising crowds in the millions.  And most of the ones who will be there will look like ACT-UP and Queer Nation, not the guy working in the next cubicle.  As if that is really going to play in middle America.  Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet where they belong. --    The views expressed herein are   |  Theodore A. Kaldis   my own only.
