I do not remember why they said that it did not work.  Anyone remember this?  Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was inevitable.  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first?  Another pair of suggestions: 1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay  safe     no matter what the pitcher does.  2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)    without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base    as if walked.  The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows the runner to  challenge  pitcher to throw over to the base.  |> Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours |> in the AL.  that is just too damn long.

I too, find myself surfing when I know that it will be enough time between each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his  jewlery .  |>  |>  |> --  |> *   Gary Huckabay   *  You think that is loud enough, a$$hole?            * |> *    Movie Rights   *  Well, if you are having trouble hearing it, sir,   * |> *   available thru  *  i had be happy to turn it up for you.
