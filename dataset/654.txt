Actually, i have got an entire list of books written by various atheist authors and I went to the largest bookstore in my area (Pittsburgh) and could not find _any_ of them.  What section of the bookstore do you find these kinds of books in?  Do you have to look in an  alternative  bookstore for most of them?  Any help would be appreciated (I can send you the list if you want).  Thanks, Nanci .........................................................................
