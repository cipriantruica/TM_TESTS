Well, let me see.  UZI, no.  M-11/9, no.  M-16/AR-15, maybe.  I remember there being a selector swtich on the AR-15.  If I remember correctly (please correct me if i am wrong) the switch would set to an  off  position or an  on  position because the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  would not the M-16 have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is correct would not it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I would not think it would be that easy but i am talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16. How about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between semi-auto and fully-auto fire?  >If so, i had love to hear the details, if only because they will demonstrate >that Kratz is blowing smoke.  >Considering that one can design a gun so that it looks just like >another gun, yet have very different properties, and that that is >quite common....  >Most kids in my neighborhood were quite young when they figured out >that my parents car was not much like Richard Petty is, even though it >looked just like it (except for the paint job).

Actually it was pretty hard for the kids in my neighborhood to figure that out as Richard Petty lived in my neighborhood and left his stock car in the  driveway. ;-)  >>Sure it is on TV but why does that make a difference?  >No, it does not, but that is irrelevant.

Well, what about what I said above?  If that is correct I guess TV would be acceptable (if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower  receiver of the AR-15/M-16).  >-andy gave Kratz a chance to back down on this in private >-- Jason Kratz <- did not take andy is offer to back down in private
