From: icop@csa.bu.edu (Antonio Pera) Subject: request for list of Boston Univ. players in NHL   \tBeing a proud BU alumnus, i had like to get a list of BU players in  the NHL so I can keep an eye on their progress. A lot of Terriers are graduating this year so I hope to see them soon in the NHL. If somebody could post or send me a list, i had appreciate it. Please note if the player graduated from here or not.
