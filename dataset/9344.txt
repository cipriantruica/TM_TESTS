What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000? >You can hardly claim that he is  hurting his team .  It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, the April 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average and a .413 OBP. that is on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks. The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he has has a long history of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for drawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB is i had be convinced that there was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBPIf it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches >and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen), >*THEN* I would agree with you that he is not taking enough pitches. My comment >that  he is not paid to walk  does not mean that he should have a license >to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it is more along the lines of: he has >batting .400 and leading the league in RBI is so what bloody difference >does it make if he is not drawing  a lot of walks? Sheesh.  it is history, Greg. Andres\' history is that he does not walk much because he swings at bad pitches, so his average is not very good. 45 AB is does not mean an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially when there is ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach has not changed. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never walks, but do not bet the rent money on it.
