The Davidians did not start shooting until after the BATF lobbed a couple genades in the windows and started shooting themselves.  >\tAlso, if the warrant is sealed, how do we know it was a \'no-knock\'?    \tEASY! If you see federal agents in body armor with sub machine guns going in throught windows, that is a No-Knock warrant. Also since the  videotape shows the BATF throwing grenades before the BD is etunred fire,  you can safely assume that they did not ring the doorbell.   P.Vasilion,  p.s. get rid of that bandwidth clogging .sig!
