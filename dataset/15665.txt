What do they do right ... or are \tthey just lucky ? In either case, this means the \'average \tthreat level\' in this country is rather low.    >>       Besides, there are other >>\tmeans of self-protection which can be just as effective >>\tas firearms.  >  >        Please name them.

I never said that these \talternative means of self-protection involved any hardware. \tWhy are \'good\' neighborhoods \'good\' ? It is not because every \tperson is armed to the teeth. It is because of (1) attitude \tand (2) cooperation. In the \'good\' neighborhoods, the residents \tmake themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when \tstrangers are lurking around. \'Good\' neighborhoods form groups \tlike \'crime-watch\' to increase this effect, and the relative \teffectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the \tgood neighbors step up and say  THAT\'S the one officer ! He \twas robbing Mr. Jones\' house .   \tIn short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at \tleast a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative. \tReplace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better \tconversationalist too and you can invite it over for a \tblock party.   >>> Freedoms and rights are not dependent on public opinion, necessity, or >>> scientific scrutiny. >> >>\tNew to this planet ?

He and Big Ron \tset-up a secret government and did all sorts of severely \tillegal deeds - the kind of stuff you and I would be doing \ttwenty-to-life for, yet he walks free. This BS happens all \tthe time. In fact, it happens so much that no one really \tcares anymore.  \'Legitimacy\' is a non-issue. Legality is \ta non-issue. So long as we get T-bones and our MTV, who \tgives a rats ass ?   >>> No arguments against RKBA can withstand scientific scrutiny. >> >>\tThey do not have to.

Pure emotion, like the abortion issue.  >>\tEvery time some young innocent is gunned-down in a drive >>\tby, every time some kid is murdered for a jacket, every >>\ttime a store clerk is executed for three dollars in change, >>\tevery time some moron kills his wife because she took the >>\tlast beer from the fridge, every time someone hears a \'bang\' >>\tin the night .... the RKBA dies.  >  >         Emotion is hard to argue against.

If they become scarce and  \tand expensive, a different psychology will take hold. \tI *think* they would be used far less to settle trivial \tcomplaints.
