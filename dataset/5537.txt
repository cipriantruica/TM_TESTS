From: greg@duke.quotron.com (greg) Subject: Piping  tail -f  to a widget: How, oh Lord, how?  i have spent the past week tearing my hair out, trying to get the output of a piped  tail -f  to end up in a widget.  i have managed to make it work in some ugly ways, but either a) X blocks on the tail and will not allow user input, b) the  tail -f  functions like just  tail  and does not follow the expansion of the file, c) the  tail -f  does not die after i have closed the pipe and destoryed the widget, or d) pclose() blocks forever waiting for tail to die. \tI _know_ this code has to exist.  Anybody have it?  A general popen() case would be perfered but at this point i shall take anything... Thanks. --  Greg Knauss (greg@quotron.com)                     Llamas, dammit!  Llamas!
