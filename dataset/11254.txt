The reason I could theoretically trust Apple (though i am a PC person myself :-) ) is that Apple has to worry about their customers deserting them if they screw up badly enough.  The government does not have any such worry; it can change the rules by force to get the outcome it wants.  This is the ultimate reason why private enterprise is usually more efficient than government agencies.
