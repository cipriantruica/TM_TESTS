You simply use GLIB to extract the image (each  frame  in a .GL is actually a complete .PCX or .CLP file), then use one of MANY available utilities to convert it.  If you do not have the GRASP package, i am afraid I cannot help you.  Sorry.      By the way, before you ask, GRASP (GRaphics Animation System for Professionals) is a commercial product that sells for just over US$300 from most mail-order companies i have seen.  And no, I do not have it.  :)                                                    Corey Webb         ____________________________________________________________________    |        Corey Webb       |  For in much wisdom is much grief, and   |    |   cbw790s@vma.smsu.edu  |  he that increaseth knowledge increaseth |    |  Bitnet: CBW790S@SMSVMA |  sorrow.            -- Ecclesiastes 1:18 |    |-------------------------|------------------------------------------|    | The  S  means I am only |     But first, are you experienced?      |    | speaking for myself.    |                  -- Jimi Hendrix         |
