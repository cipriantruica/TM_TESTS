When your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object, there are only four things to dissipate the energy: the immoveable object, the helmet shell, the helmet liner, the rider is head, the rider is ego (ok, five). Assuming that the helmet/ head assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in the other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it is the the liner that is dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were cracked, it will not absorb energy form an impact in that area. If it is the head that is getting jiggled, maybe the new gear is not of as high quality after all?  i have        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD   kV      got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca                          ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada
