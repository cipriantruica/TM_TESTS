From: sweda@css.itd.umich.edu (Sean Sweda) Subject: Royals final run total...   i have been saying this for quite some time, but being absent from the net for a while I figured i had stick my neck out a bit...  The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL team since the inception of the DH rule.  (p.s. any ideas what this is?)  They will fall easily short of 600 runs, that is for damn sure.  I cannot believe these media fools picking them to win the division (like our Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of genius for the trades/aquisitions he has made)  c-ya  Sean   -- Sean Sweda                                      sweda@css.itd.umich.edu CSS/ITD Consultant\t\t\t   President, Bob Sura Fan Club GM/Manager Motor City Marauders Internet Baseball League\t\t\t\t    play ball! \t
