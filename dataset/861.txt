Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your calculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is 307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I do not think it is a BIOS mode.  I would not bet that all VGA cards can do that either.  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and 640x480.  That by definition is SVGA, though not very high SVGA.
