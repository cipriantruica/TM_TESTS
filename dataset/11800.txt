Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+   that is forced on ring and tip when the phone is supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever scheme you use, make sure you have got at least 200V-rated components on  the frontend.  Also remember that, if i am not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets dropped across that 600ohms.  that is fine until you are down to roughly 12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that far down is probably a big no-no.  The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??      tip  ------->|----- / / / -----+----------+               rectifier  resistor  |          |               diode                |                                                V          /                           zener  /---/           resistor                                    |          /                                    |          |                                    |          V   LED                                    |         ---                                    |          |     ring --------------------------+----------+  This is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you get the idea.  Choose a high-efficiency LED so you do not need much current to get it to light up.  Choose values for the other components as required.  aaron
