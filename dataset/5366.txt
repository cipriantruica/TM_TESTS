We want to configure our X11R5 sytem (i486 33Mhz running BSD-like UNIX) comming up with a chooser menu with different machines on it (works) an then connect to them. But the only connection works is localhost! An \'X -indirect \' works very well! The configuration:  \t\t- starting the \'xdm\' at boot time with no servers specified \t\t   in Xservers \t\t- starting the X-server at boot time with X -indirect localhost  \t     ---> the chooser menu appears with the machines named in \t\t  Xacces bye \t\t\t\'*\tCHOOSER   ... BROADCAST\t \t\t- the number of users on this machines and the load is  \t\t    displayed correct  \t\t- selecting an other machine than my own host the X-server \t\t   starts and nothing happens, after a time out the CHOOSER menu \t\t   appears again.  I know the xdm bug in X11R4, but all machines running X11R5  Please help \t\t\tLars   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lars Koeller\t\t\t    E-Mail: uphya001@odie.Uni-Bielefeld.de Universitaet Bielefeld (Germany)\t    uphya001@dave.hrz.Uni-Bielefeld.de Fakultaet fuer Physik / D0-231\t    Phone:  +49 521-106-5375 Universitaetsstr. 25\t\t    Fax:    +49 521-106-5244 4800 Bielefeld 1\t\t    Telex:  932 362
