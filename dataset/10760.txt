I believed the Democrats stood for principles of personal    privacy while it was the Neanderthal Republicans that wanted into every    aspect of our lives.     Clinton is just more clever than the other guy. Looks like gun control for    privacy technology. One small step at a time.  Remember  Defend Firearms - Defeat Dukakis , followed by Bush is soon-after- election support for gun-control?   This is the Democrats\' version  Defend Free Speech - Reject Republicans  followed by speech control.     Wait a minute....  Let me think about this.     Hmmm, I feel better now. I believe the White House when they tell us    this first step is, in fact, the final step. All is OK. we have nothing to fear.    they are here to help us.   God bless America.
