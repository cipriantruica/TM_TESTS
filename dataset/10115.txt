Actually, fired-coach George Kingston was a third of the GM triumvirate.  Now that the trio is now duo (Dean Lombardi and Chuck Grillo), the Sharks are already on their 3rd  office of the GM . And a 4th is likely to happen before September; they will either add the new coach to the OofGM, or name a single GM. So your wager should be amended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the Panther is get their 2nd. cannot wait to see how the next season is NHL Guide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks.  Given the depth of next year is draft, the expansion draft rules, and the reputation of their GMs, Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the first 90s expansion teams to win a Cup.  San Jose and Ottawa have instability at the GM position, something that Philly, NYI, Edmonton, and Calgary did not have when they won their first Cups. Pittsburgh did, but they needed a quarter century. --  Mike Eisler, mre@Eng.Sun.Com  ``Not only are they [Leafs] the best team, but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburgh is.
