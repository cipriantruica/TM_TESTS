From: WKWINKEL@ibm.rz.uni-passau.de Subject: Re:color or Monochrome?  Walther, i had have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering. i had only suggest using the color screen if it does 800*600 without flickering. If this is not too small for your tastes at a 14 .... Personally i had prefer the mono-screen as I always have quite a few windows open. If you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color  isurplus\' is worth trading in  the smaller size. If you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors. I used a 14  mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors looked I choose on a color screen.   Regards, Olaf Winkelhake
