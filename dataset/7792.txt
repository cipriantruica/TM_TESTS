Often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means    that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  In my case, I    had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an    apartment carport and not visible from the street.  They evidently    decided the beemer was not worth stealing, but did try the next night to    steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.    A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.   I know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the things that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts i have heard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto Guzzis and other relative  exotics  since there is not a large demand for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes.   -- Jonathan E.
