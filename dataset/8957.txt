From:  (Austin Jacobs) Subject: BOB KNEPPER WAS DAMN RIGHT!  do not you GUYS think so?  I mean, c\'mon!  What the heck are women doing even THINKING of getting into baseball.  They cause so many problems.  Just look at Lisa Olson.  Remember that feisty reporter that entered the New England Patriots locker room?  She started crying like a LITTLE GIRL!  I just do not think women belong in a man is sport.  Before you smart guys flame me for this, I know the given example was about football.  Who cares?  It still applies to other MALE sports.  How can we have women umpires?  Jeez!  Look at Pam Postema.  Just because she is a woman, everybody on the face of the earth thinks it is great that she is getting an opportunity to ump.  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of roast beef, you had see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires. Besides, she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a foul tip off of Wade Boggs\' bat. Or Jose Oquendo is bat. Either way, there are too many complications.   \xef\xbf\xbdAustin Jacobs (Bob Knepper Fan Club Member
