I seem to have a problem configuring my lpt port to accept this.  How can you adjust baud, parity, etc. to fit the system?  I tried MODE, but it did not work.  If anyone can help, post of e-mail.  Thanx.  --  \t Abort, Retry, FORMAT?!?!? \tDoctor, give me the chainsaw... \tTrust me! i am a scientist!  \t\t\t\tLarry Henson
