Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.  i am guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple is internal data structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they came up with their own data structure.  If it is the latter, then they will not be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files, there are not many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region is not being stored on disk and transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it does not matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.  I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware, and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What other patents does Apple have on the Mac? --  Joe Schwartz       E-mail: xor@acm.rpi.edu  or  xor@clotho.acm.rpi.edu MapInfo Corp. 200 Broadway       These are my own opinions.
