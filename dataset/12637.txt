Instead of *.chemistry, how about splitting the classification into *.biochemistry (which are probably the topics you are thinking of) and *.pharmaceutical (which otherwise might end up in *.(bio)chemistry)?  (This is separate from the issue of whether there is sufficient potential news volume to support either or both groups.)  i shall add \'em to my medical/health newsgroup wish list (which i am looking forward to posting and discussing -- but not for another 10 days or so).
