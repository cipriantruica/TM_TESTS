This disease is  universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the  tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum  member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki is track record for this disease.   He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from  glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had  audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.   After the forum member is father began Dr. Burzynski is treatment in  September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his  oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of  shrinkage or necrosis.  The patient is oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live  past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski is  treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski is  treatment, she is since changed her attitude toward continuing these  treatments, saying  if it am not broke, do not fix it.   Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a  protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,  and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.  There is little  understanding of the actual mechanism of activity.  /*********************************************************************/ /*                      --- David E.
