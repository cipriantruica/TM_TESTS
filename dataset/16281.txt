I doubt if Koresh had let the BATF have a look inside his place as they  intended to do,  orchestrated character assassination, noise torture, and a holocaust  would never have come to pass.  The BD is killed members of the BATF on the first day.  Orchestrated character assassination and noise torture  seem like a small retribution.  The use of tanks is quesionable however.    --Abhijit --  BHATTACHARYA,ABHIJIT Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta Georgia, 30332 uucp:\t  ...!{decvax,hplabs,ncar,purdue,rutgers}!gatech!prism!gt5311b Internet: gt5311b@prism.gatech.edu
