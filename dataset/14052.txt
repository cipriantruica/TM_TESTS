Never mind the legal status.  >Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you? >The UN cannot other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?  Nick is right about this.  it is always easier to obtain forgiveness than permission.  Not many people remember that Britain is King George III expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany/appalachian mountains.  Said subjects basically said,  Stop us if you can.   He could not.  >If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will >stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you?   that is how the USA started.  Of course, that is also how the Bolivarian Republic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  It did not have quite the staying power of the USA.  i am sure there are more examples of going far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right now.  >What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your >services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what >ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..  Or do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want to carry out as  scientific research  which just coincidentally requires the recovery of megatonnes of minerals (or whatever), then go at it.  >Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but cannot for soem reason >or another, but who will give you a  home .. Such as Saudia Arabia or >whatever..  Lute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya (I think) in the late \'70 is for his commercial space launch project (one of the very earliest).  It was killed by Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise missiles in Africa, which made Libya renege on the arrangement.   Doug Loss
