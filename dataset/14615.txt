Or is a woman who >is raped considered not to have been abstaining?  I no longer have the textbook, but abstinence was defined as something like  no contact between the penis and the vagina, vulva, or area  immediately surrounding the vulva, and no transfer of semen to the vagina, vulva, or area surrounding the vulva .    That is, abstinence was not discussed as  sex outside of marriage is morally wrong  but as keep  the sperm away from the ovum and conception  is impossible. The moral question I recall the teacher asking was,  is it okay to create a child if you are not able to be a good parent yet?   -jen  --       //  jenk@microsoft.com  // msdos testing
