Is there an independent source for this assertion, or is it all from the Christian Bible?  Is there any record at all of anything he built?  A table, a house, some stairs (Norm Abrams says the real test of a carpenter is skill is building stairs with hand tools).  Did he leave any plans behind for, say kitchen counters and cabinets?  Did he build his own cross? If so, did he use pressure-treated lumber?  Gotta use that pressure-treated anywhere that wood meets concrete, but it holds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications.  I keep seeing these bumper-stickers that say  My boss is a Jewish Carpenter,  but they are always on the back of Ford Escorts, and a real carpenter is apprentice would probably drive a pickup, so i am out for verification that he really was a carpenter.
