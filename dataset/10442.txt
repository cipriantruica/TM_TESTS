Well, partly because I, as an ardent fan of both sports, would rather see Game 3 of the NHL playoffs than Game 3 of 162 of the MLB season (even if the bb game involves the Red Sox).\t  ESPN may have had contractual obligations. I understand that part. But it is a bit inaccurate to call us  selfish  just because we want to watch the watch the game we love. Am I, as a baseball fan,  selfish  when I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month? I do not think so.  While, ESPN may have contractual obligations, we, as their consumers, have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us. there is certainly nothing wrong with that.      ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++     + Bri Farenell\t\t\tfarenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu   +     + AHL, ECAC and Boston Bruins contact for rec.sport.hockey\t\t   +     + Adirondack Red Wings, Calder Cup Champs: \'81  \'86  \'89  \'92\t   +     + Clarkson Hockey, ECAC Tournament Champs: \'66  \'91  \'93\t\t   +     + Glens Falls High Hockey, NY Division II State Champs: \'90  \'91       +     + AHL fans: join the AHL mailing list: ahl-news-request@andrew.cmu.edu +     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   \t\t
