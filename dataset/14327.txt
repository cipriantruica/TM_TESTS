The Army started \tfunding the laboratory and had jurisdiction untill the late 1950s when \tNASA took over. The early research conducted at the Laboratory \tled to many applications the first being Jet-assisted takeoff rockets \tfor aircraft.  I think this should explain where JPL got it is name, I \tshould know, I worked there for five wonderful years. ----------mike.  >--  >------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >Jim Cobban   |  jcobban@bnr.ca                        |  Phone: (613) 763-8013 >BNR Ltd.     |  bnrgate.bnr.ca!bcars5!jcobban         |  FAX:   (613) 763-2626
