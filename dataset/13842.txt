If I read you right, you are saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a  we have the money, why not?  approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. it is not like they would be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. it is a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it is good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, i am pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).
