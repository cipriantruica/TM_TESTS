From: gtoal@gtoal.com (Graham Toal) Subject: Re: Is key escrow enough?  \t  The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip, as \topposed to what is allegedly programmed therein, raise yet another trust \tissue.  Even if we assume that these  trusted agents  are really entering \ta wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the \ttime to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not \tdoing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry \tat carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be \tpunching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program \tthe chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they \tare feeding into the system.  S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all compromised.  If they are not compromisable, why the hell not use a hardware true random number source.  There is not a random number source *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.  Nope, it cannot be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access - the (possibly honest) key escrow that police forces have to use, and ostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything* on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for favours.
