As far as I can tell the grips look and feel the same as the standard grips.  They are *not* soft.  Last weekend I did a 500 mile round-trip and got to a point where it was in the 30s and raining.  Those heated grips were *great*.  i have only had the bike a month and the heated grips are already one of my favorite features on the bike. -- ******************************************************************************* * Bill Ranck             (703) 231-9503                     Bill.Ranck@vt.edu * * Computing Center, Virginia Polytchnic Inst. & State Univ., Blacksburg, Va.  * *******************************************************************************
