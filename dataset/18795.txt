Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be.  The OED gives the etymology of  sibyl  as coming from the ancient Greek   \tsigma iota beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha  \t( S i b ih l l a )  which is claimed to come from the Doric   \tsigma iota omicron beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha  \t( s i o b ih l l a )  which (if I read it properly) in turn came from the Attican (Athenian)  \ttheta epsilon omicron beta omicron upsilon lambda eta  \t( th eh o b o ih l ae )  I do not know much about Attis, but it would not surprise me to learn that this God was tied to the Athenian capital  \tAlpha tau tau iota kappa upsilon sigma \t(a t t i k u s)  The OED does not list any etymology for  Cybele  since that is a propper noun, but I suggest that the Greek spelling of that word would be much closer to the anticedants of Sibyl than the two words are now. Perhaps  Cybele  is a French or Latin spelling?
