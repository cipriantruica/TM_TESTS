Dan  Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD- 1304 because of several manufacturing flaws.  The new model is now the 1430, which just like Apple is new Sony Trinitrom CLAIMS to be 14 inches. i am not sure of the details on the defects, but I work at our schools bookstore and can tell you that nearly half of them were returned with some kind of  defect or another.
