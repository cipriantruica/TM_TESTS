From: andreasa@dhhalden.no (ANDREAS ARFF) Subject: comp.graphics.programmer  Hello netters  Sorry, I do not know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing, probably should be a CFV, but since I do not have tha ability to create a  news group myself, I just want to start the discussion.   I enjoy reading c.g very much, but I often find it difficult to sort out what i am interested in. Everything from screen-drivers, graphics cards, graphics programming and graphics programs are discused here. What i had like is a  comp.graphics.programmer news group. What do you other think.   Arff  Also for the not religous confessor, there is a mystery of higher values, who has birth mankind - to the last - builds upon. They are indisputible. And  often disregarded. Seldom you hear them beeing prized, as seldom as you hear  a seeing man prizeing what he sees.
