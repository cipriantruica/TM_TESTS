We probably agree on this       more than you think--welfare was invented to solve a problem of the       30 is, but the poverty is now so much worse, and our economic infra-       structure has been so eroded, that it just cannot keep up any more.        You mean, since your philosophy took over, the economy has almost     collapsed.      Excuse me, *my* philosophy?  You do not have any idea what *my* philosophy   is.  The American economy has had its ups and downs through a number of   prevailing economic philosophies.  But then, economics is hardly a science.  In my lifetime, your philosophy -- socialism masquerading as a liberal welfare state -- has been in ascendancy.    No, I mean exactly what I wrote--the welfare system of the New Deal is   wholly inadequate to cope with the current state of affairs.  Absolutely.  So the response of socialists is take us even further into socialism.            (2) Whether or not the fathers work           is not germane to single mothers.             Very true.  But the promotion of casual sexuality is something that         plays a part in the single mother problem.          i shall buy that--and there is lots of reasons for it, extremely far down on       the list being the flash-in-the-pan media attention a bunch of middle-       class dropouts got for their philosophy and experimentation.          Flash-in-the-pan?  No, your subculture has utterly dominated the     TV and movie industries for two decades now.      *My* subculture?  My, we are getting personal.  The only subculture I see   dominating the TV and movie industries is *money*.  If you shall buy it,   they will sell it.  And as recent movements to boycott TV advertisers have   shown, they are *very* sensitive about what sells.  Whatever happened to   personal responsibility, anyway?  Or am I personally responsible for   the decline in that, too?  To the extent that people have been encouraged to NOT be responsible for themselves, yes.          Come on.  You and I both know that the major problem of this society         today is not a lack of employment, it is a lack of people willing to work.          Huh???  Tell that to the single mother I know who was laid off from       her $10/hour job at a hospital and now works 2 full-time minimum-       wage jobs to barely be able to support herself and her kid.  *Barely.*       Hey, she is too proud to go on public assistance, but the only jobs       she can find are menial and with no benefits.  And no career path       either--they find excuses to lay people off and hire new ones rather       than give raises and perks.  And why not?  it is a lot cheaper.        Oddly enough, all the unskilled or semiskilled people I know manage     to find employment almost immediately.  Maybe she needs to move to a     cheaper part of the country, where jobs are plentiful, and the cost     of living is lower.      The west side of Chicago is about as cheap as it gets--squalor city.   Tell me about all these places where it is cheap to live and jobs are   abundant--i shall pass them on.  Sonoma County.    You live in a strange and wondrous place, sir.  Inexpensive housing,  Not exactly cheap, but not Los Angeles, either.    lots of employment, and utterly surrounded by socialists.  Well, I suppose   that is the sort of environment that would attract socialists, or at least   not dissuade them.  No, it is that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists -- all the spoiled rich kids, feeling guilty about their wealth.  But not guilty enough to give it away -- they just look for politicians to take MY more limited wealth away.        I see a lot of people willing--nay, eager--to work.  What I do not see       is a system that makes it at all feasible to do so.  it is not just       welfare, which nobody enjoys, but there just are not the jobs any more.       When the US was expanding industrial capacity there was always a mill       to go work in--skills to learn, a future.  Now there is only McDonalds.        Odd.  Not the experience of anyone I know.  Just the opposite.      In California???  Yup.        Mr. Cramer, I was there:  Hippiedom was a very low-budget operation.       Our drugs were cheap.        The money I was referring to was Aid to Families with Druggie      Cohabitators (AFDC).      Well, I doubt that much of this goes to drugs--there is not much left after   buying food, and there is very little in the first place.  Sure, you read   about such cases now and then, but that is what makes them news.  Show me   your statistics about AFDC abuse.  I can tell you that relatives I have known, the drugs came first, the food was secondary.    Ken Perlow   ***** ***** --  Clayton E. Cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer  My opinions, all mine!
