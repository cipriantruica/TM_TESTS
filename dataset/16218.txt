Yes, there were drunks, saloons, mining camps, and thugs.  However, as McGrath showed, the thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  McGrath claims that this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while they really did care when thugs preyed on others.  >citizens should be able to own weapons, but we see no sense in some >types.  We have not figured out that those distinctions do not actually work. Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.
