It sounds like she has a problem.  She has a problem opening up to her husband so she is lesbian.  WHAT? In a marrige, a couple is supposed to open up to each other.  Because she did not feel comfortable opening up to her husband she gets a divorce and comes to the conclusion that she is lesbian.  Before anyone gets maried they should make sure that they would feel comfortable  open up the deepest part of her soul to her husband .   Sex, in her mind, is only a part of the whole relationship.   Did she think it was diffrent with a man. That might be her problem.  In Christ is Love, Bryan
