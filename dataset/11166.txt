They may collect the data, but making sense of it is another matter.  On sci.crypt i am a graduate CS major (with strong math background) and experienced programmer taking a cryptology course.  (<< keyword for alleged NSA filters).  On sci.skeptic i am an ex-physics major who has a new-age flake, talking about silly things like how a person is expectations colors what he sees.  On talk.religion.newage i am a physics geek who enjoys squashing interesting idea with WASP science, although I do write occasional posts showing a minimal knowledge of Zen, mythology, etc.  I could go on, but i am sure you see my point.  i am a single person, but I react differently on different groups (admittedly, in part because i am a contrarian you always shouts  but, on the other hand... ). On top of that, I _loath_ certainty and have taken public positions in the past for no reason other than to challenge  conventional wisdom . I wish them luck in figuring out who  I  am based on that information.  (They can probably figure out i am liberal, with a technical degree but humanistic interests, from a common thread throughout my posts. But that describes a fair portion of the users of Internet).  --  Bear Giles bear@cs.colorado.edu/fsl.noaa.gov
