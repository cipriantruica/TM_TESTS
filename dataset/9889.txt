You think that is bad ... one year, we had all three New York teams in the playoffs and the cableco operator (SCNY once shared a channel with BET but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6PM) did not know what I was talking about ...  While it is nice that the NHL is back on American network TV, it faces the same problems as it did with the All Star game.  Local preemptions and zero promotion (okay, I do not watch that much TV so i am just foaming all right?).  The league should have made sure that it was solid on cable before going to the networks.  In year one of the new ESPN contract, the saturation coverage of SCA (all other games shown to completion, like the Quebec-Montreal and Sabres-Bruins overtimes) is missed around here.  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.
