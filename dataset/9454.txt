Look at Matt Williams the year after : \tMitchell was gone. Look no further. Not a scientific : \tstudy, but it shall show the truth for Matt. Besides, Bonds : \t_wants_ to bat 5th  I had thought that Williams batted after Mitchell.  would not that show that Williams does better at 5th rather than 4th?  The point is moot, though, becase Clark pretty much demands to be 3rd and, like you point out, Bonds does like to bat 5th.  The only person left to bat 4th is Williams.  Mike West west@esd.dl.nec.com
