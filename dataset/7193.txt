From: george.howell%goucher@wb3ffv.ampr.org (George Howell)  Subject: SOME TAURUS MISC. MAINT.  -> 4) Are there any fairly cheap ( performance on this car? Unfortunately, a Taurus is not exactly a -> muscle car, so i am looking for ways to increase the performance.  There is a company in Florida that sells computer chips that supposedly get a few HP and Torque out of the 3.0. do not have the address, but saw the ad in Hot Rod and some other car magazines. Also, you could open up the exhaust (get an exhaust with a larger i.d.)  Hope this helps. If you find anything else, let me know. i have got a 1990 Taurus L.
