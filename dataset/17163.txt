Why do I detect the faint scent of bias here?  Could it be because   the Israelis are not feasting?  Perhaps because the Gazans are not   starving?    The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population   density in the world,    Oh, oh.  I had not realized that the Chinese had wiped out Hong   Kong, or that Singapore had sunk into the sea, or that several   other cities had vanished.  Either that, or this is a taste of   the quality of \'Research\' we are about to see.                          has been cut off from the world for weeks.    So I suppose that the footage on CNN last night was archival,   and Ted Turner was faking it after the NBC style?  Or is this   another wee little exaggeration for the sake of a Greater Truth?    The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of   Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the   strip and seek work in Israel.    Hey!  You forgot that Israel has also denied Syrians the same   \'right\'.  Come to think of it, Mexico is denying me that \'right\'   evan as I write this!  Or are you ever so gently suggesting that   Israel, unlike every other country on Earth, should not be allowed   to control traffic across its borders?    While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the   Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help   the Gazan resistance.  The only help given to Gazans by Israeli   Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.    This sounds like a parallel, but it is not.  Tell us how many Poles   went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there.  Oops!  For a moment   there I forgot that in Poland, \'humanitarian assistance  could   get you killed.  Come to think of it, humanitarian assistance to   the Gazans can get Israelis killed, too.  Except that in Gaza,   it is likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office.    So let us keep the parallel.  Since the gross numbers are not the   same, we will need a proportionality value.  Should we use:     * Gazan vs Jewish initial population?     * Gazan vs Jewish death rates?     * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation?     * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the \'resistance\'?     * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims?   Since the two cases are so comparable, it should not matter   which we pick, they will all be about the same, right?  ------------  Contrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily kill off the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to. (No, i am not exaggerating.  And I really do not want to discuss how.) Note that a million dead Gazans do not get much more headline space than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once exterminated, they cannot keep popping up as headlines.  So if a  Final Solution  for Gaza would be so much better from a *Realpolitik* standpoint, why does not Israel go for it?  A difficult question to answer for those who cannot believe anything good about Jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fit the facts into the theory.   --- D. C.
