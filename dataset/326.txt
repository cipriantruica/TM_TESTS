From: Patrick C Leger  Subject: it is all Mary is fault!  You know, it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing can be blamed solely on Mary.  So, she is married to Joseph.  She gets knocked up.  What do you think ol\' Joe will do if he finds she is been getting around?  So Mary comes up with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.  Actually, it cannot be all THAT ridiculous, considering the number of people that believe it.  Anyway, she never tells anyone the truth, and even tells poor little Jesus that he has hot shit, the Son of God.  Everyone else tells him this too, since they have bought Mary is story.  So, what does Mary actually turn out to be?  An adultress and a liar, and the cause of mankind is greatest folly...  Just my recently-minted two cents.
