I would use the FM transmitter chip from Motorola (Linear and   Interface Databook), a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer (e.g. SBL-1 from   mini circuits lab). Everything is done in the FM chip and then mixed up with   the oscillator frequency. Just have a look at the ARRL Handbook. There are lots   of ideas in there about oscillators and mixing. I do not think, there are single   chip designs for such high frequencies yet.  > Thanks in advance. >  > Graham Castledine.
