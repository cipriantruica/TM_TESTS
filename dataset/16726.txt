I think that perhaps you should print flyers on this topic, and your   reasons for thinking the way you do. You should then distribute them   amongst the world is population. You see, I do not think there are many   people who are aware of this fact. Thank you for telling us the truth.    BTW: I would start by sending your flyers to each of the UN officials. \t   Also, after you have distributed your flyers you might consider        hiding. You see, I think that once more people read what you think        they will have to lock you up in a mental institute; and do not think        they will ever let you out.     It is a strange strange world you live in. I feel sorry for you.  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Neophytos Iacovou                                 University of Minnesota                     email:  iacovou@cs.umn.edu  Computer Science Department                         ...!rutgers!umn-cs!iacovou
