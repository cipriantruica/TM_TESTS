Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much  less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the last three years, and even the existing teams cannot be moved for less than  $50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.  Pettit gambled and lost. Now he shall have to pay more.  -SG
