Since the actual verdicts were not known by the authorities, it was smart not to allow  Friday night for fighting  (sorry, Elton) and to seal them for this morning.  Also, it allows for maximum daylight to wear down and frustrate any potential troublemakers, as well as give more preparation time.  >I guess we can look forward to a weekend of rioting, eh?

A net-contact in L.A. tells me that the alert will remain over this weekend, as some elements may find excuse over the not-guilty verdicts on three of five charges (the aiding-and-abetting).  Those acquittals seem to balance out the fact that Rodney King himself was not any kind of angel that night, speeding and fleeing et al.  However ...  Another consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on the excessive force charges (Koons for incompetance, and Powell for overreacting --- both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops interviewed) that might get out of hand. )-;  Also, some elements may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops (a dumb move, obviously).  And, Koreans are still scared and certain people are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year.  A Commander from Nassau, Long Island was questioned about how his people would have handled Rodney King, and he said  we would have let him roll around in the dirt \'til he got tired, then handcuff him .  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.
