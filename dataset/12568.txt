You do not say what kind of  electronic equipment  you mean.  it is hard to give a generic answer.  There is essentially no solvent that will not do things like washing lubricant out of switches.  When we have needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things, we have just used distilled water.  The key thing to remember is to make sure the gear is *completely* dry before powering it up again.  We let it dry for several days to be damn sure.  I doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water.  I would be very wary of CCl4, not least because it is dangerous to *you* even if it is not going to harm the equipment -- not only is it poisonous, but I believe it is now known to be carcinogenic. --  SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
