This jerk does not have a heart, and it beats me why you are apologizing for him. In my book, behavior like this is unprofessional, inexcusable, and beyond the pale. If he has overworked, it is because he has too busy raking in the bucks. More likely, he just likes to push women around. i had fire the s.o.b., and get myself another doctor.  --  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~              |      Die Welt ist alles, was Zerfall ist.     | Peter Cash   |       (apologies to Ludwig Wittgenstein)      |cash@convex.com ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
