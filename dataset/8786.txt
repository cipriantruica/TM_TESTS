American League East\t W\t L\tGB 1)New York Yankees\t93\t69\t-- 2)Baltimore Orioles\t90\t72\t 3 3)Toronto Blue Jays\t86\t76\t 7 4)Cleveland Indians     84      78       9 5)Boston Red Sox\t77\t85\t16 6)Milwaukee Brewers\t74\t88\t19 7)Detroit Tigers\t73\t89\t20  American League West\t W\t L\tGB 1)Minnesota Twins\t94\t68\t-- 2)Kansas City Royals\t92\t70\t 2 3)Texas Rangers     \t85\t77\t 9 4)Chicago White Sox\t77\t85\t17 5)Oakland Athletics\t74\t88\t20 6)Seattle Mariners\t70\t92\t24 7)California Angels\t65\t97\t29  AL MVP-Kirby Puckett AL Cy Young-Kevin Appier AL Rookie of the Year-Tim Salmon AL Manager of the Year-Buck Showalter AL Comeback Player of the Year-Ozzie Guillen  National League East\t W\t L\tGB 1)St. Louis Cardinals\t91\t71\t-- 2)Philadelphia Phillies 89\t73\t 2 3)Montreal Expos\t88\t74\t 3 4)New York Mets\t\t84\t78\t 7 5)Chicago Cubs\t\t79\t83\t12 6)Pittsburgh Pirates\t73\t89\t18 7)Florida Marlins\t54     108\t37  National League West\t W\t L\tGB 1)Atlanta Braves\t96\t66\t-- 2)Cincinnati Reds\t94\t68\t 2 3)Houston Astros\t89\t73\t 7 4)Los Angeles Dodgers\t82\t80\t14 5)San Francisco Giants\t81\t81\t15 6)San Diego Padres\t75\t87\t21 7)Colorado Rockies\t59     103\t37  NL MVP-Barry Larkin NL Cy Young-John Smoltz NL Rookie of the Year-Wil Cordero NL Manager of the Year-Joe Torre NL Comeback Player of the Year-Eric Davis  NL Champions-St. Louis Cardinals AL Champions-Minnesota Twins World Champions-St. Louis Cardinals  The St. Louis picks are what my heart says. What my brain says, is they will win the division, lose to the Braves in the NLCS, and the Braves will win the Series against Minnesota. But for now, i shall stick with the Cards all the way.  Kevin
