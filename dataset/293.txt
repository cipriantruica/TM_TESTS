If I claim something is a general trend, then to disprove this, >>I guess you had have to show that it was not a general trend. >No, if you are going to claim something, then it is up to you to prove it. >Think  Cold Fusion .  Well, i have provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding mating practices, etc.  I do not think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined...  >>Try to find  immoral  non-mating-related activities. >So you are excluding mating-related-activities from your  natural morality ?  No, but mating practices are a special case.  i shall have to think about it some more.  >>Yes, I think that the natural system can be objectively deduced with the >>goal of species propogation in mind.  But, I am not equating the two >>as you so think.

Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural system is a subset of the objective ones.  >Now, since homosexuality has been observed in most animals (including >birds and dolphins), are you going to claim that  most animals  have >the capacity of being immoral?  I do not claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It is not harmful, although it is not helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, do not you mean  bisexuality?   >>>>Because we cannot determine to what end we should be  moral.  >Are you claiming to be a group?   We  usually implies more than one entity.  This is standard jargon.  Read any textbook.  The  we  forms are used throughout.  >>Well, i am saying that these goals are not inherent.

But a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be true.  I do not think your postulate would be valid.  >Guess which one people are going to be more receptive to.
