Blue LEDs just recently became available and the materials they are made of are expensive. Maybe in the future they will become less expensive (and brighter), but for now it is going to cost you and the output will be limited. If they ever do get as efficient and cost effective as red and green LEDs, you are probably going to see a whole new family of color displays.           Charlie Brett - Ft. Collins, CO
