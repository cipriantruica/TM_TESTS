From: Patrick Walker  Subject: Red Wings Goespel...  Detroit is going to beat Toronto in 6 or LESS!!!   Granted, Gilmour should get the Hart Trophy, NOT Lemieux... Just Look at what Gilmour did for Toronto.  When you think of Toronto, who comes to mind, Gilmour, Andreychuk, Potvin...ah...did I mentio n Gilmour?  Back to Detroit...  There really is not a team that could stand up to them if all the players on the team play to their potential, no one could stop them.  Yzerman, Fedorov, Coffey, Lindstrom... there is more firepower there than Pittsburgh... and they do not tri p over their own skates! -----------------------------------------------------------------------   /------------/ Detroit over Toronto in 5     Patrick Walker  / /-- ------/   Detroit over Chicago in 6     University of New Bruns.  ! !  !---/      Detroit over Vancouver in 6   Canada     __/ /        Detroit over Nords in 6        Disco Still Sucks!   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
