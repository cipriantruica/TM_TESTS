From: asson@chacmool.stsci.edu (Drew Justin Asson) Subject: Ext. Hard Drives for my SE/30   i am interested in getting an external hard drive for my SE/30.  i have got an internal 40MB that is pretty full, even with compression s/w.   Alot of people talk about $/MB, what is a good ratio?  i am thinking of adding either an 80 or a 100 (or 105).  What brands would people suggest?  Finally, places to buy from?  Are more popular mail-order places better to order from or the places that JUST sell hard drives (e.g. ones that advertise in the back of MacWorld and MacUser).  Thanks in advance.  If e-mail replies are sent, i shall compile them and post them.  -- Drew -- ========================================================================== | Drew J.
