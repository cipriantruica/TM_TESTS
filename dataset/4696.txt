I can imaging that they are getting hard to sell, given that   1. a C610 is way faster, and is comparable in price.  2. an LCIII is about the same speed, and is way cheaper. So your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people that IIvx is are a much better buy than a C610 just so he can get rid of all his old stock!  No disrespect to dealers or the IIvx intended!  -- Jon Nielsen (jon@cs.uwa.edu.au) Department of Computer Science University of Western Australia
