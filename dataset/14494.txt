The  artist renderings  that i have seen of the HST reboost still have the arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree angle to the Shuttle.  I think the rendering was conceived before the array replacemnet was approved, so i am not sure if the current reboost will occur with the arrays deployed or not.  However, it does not  appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost. >  >For the Gamma-Ray Observatory, one of the design requirements was that >there be no stored-energy mecahnisms (springs, explosive squibs, gas shocks, >etc.) used for deployment.

The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an on-orbit replacement for the instrument module on EUVE.  That way, you get two instruments for the price of one spacecraft bus (the Explorer Platform).  A  second on-orbit replacement was also considered, with the FUSE telescope.  >--  >\t\tDavid M.
