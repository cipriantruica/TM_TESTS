However, cruise control is a pretty dumb option. what is the point? If you are on a long trip, you floor the gas and keep your eyes on the rear-view mirror for cops, right?  Power seats are pretty dumb too, unless you are unlucky enough to have to share your car. Otherwise, you had just adjust it once and just leave it like that.  --  +-------=Allen Tom=-------+  you are not like the others... You like the same | atom@soda.berkeley.edu  |  things I do...
