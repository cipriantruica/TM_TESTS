From: glb6j@smarine.UUCP (Guy Babineau) Subject: How do you find a window id given its name   I want to do the equivalent of an  xwininfo -name  via a call or set of calls in Xlib.  I need to map a windows name to its id. it is probably easy, but i have only been programming in X for a little while. i have looked in the O\'reilly books and did not find it and I also checked the FAQ and could not find it.  Email to one of the following addresses and i shall post a response if it seems reasonable to do so.   Guy --  Guy L.
