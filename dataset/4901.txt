From: s_ledoux@csc32.enet.dec.com (Scott LeDoux) Subject: Icon Animation    Hi Folks.  As part of my self-introduction to X i have been trying to do some simple icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you are done. Alternately you can set window manager hints.  These methods do not seem to work with icons which your application does not specifically own.  In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in  my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes any difference, i am using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.  Thanks - Scott :)
