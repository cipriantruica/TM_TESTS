In the  sex ed  portion of the  high school  health  course I took in 1984, it was impressed that the only 100% positive way to *not* get pregnant was to *not* have sex.  Other methods of contraception were discussed, in the framework of a chart which showed both the _expected_ failure rate (theoretical, assumes no mistakes) and the _actual_ failure rate (based on research). Top of the chart was something like this:    Method                  Expected         Actual   ------                 Failure Rate    Failure Rate  Abstinence                 0%              0%    And NFP (Natural Family Planning) was on the bottom. The teacher even said,  i have had some students tell me that they cannot use anything for birth control because they are Catholic. Well, if you are not married and you are a practicing Catholic, the *top* of the list is your slot, not  the *bottom*.  Even if you are not religious, the top of the list is safest.   Yes, this was a public school and after Dr Koop is  failing abstinence, use a condom  statement on the prevention of AIDS.  -jen  --       //  jenk@microsoft.com  // msdos testing
