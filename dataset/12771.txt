Nothing unisual. Quote:   Chinese Restaurant Syndrome (CRS): a transient syndrome, associated with arterial dilatation, due to ingestion of monosodium glutamate, which is used liberally in seasoning chinese food; it is characterized by throbbing of the head, lightheadedness, tightness of the jaw, neck and shoulders, and bachache.

Brain produces and uses some MSG naturally, but not in doses it is served at some chinese places.  Having said that, i might add, that in MHO, MSG does not enhance flavor enoughf for me to miss it.  When I go to chinese places, I order food without MSG.  Goos places will do it for you. A prerequisite for such a service would be a waiter, capable of understanding, what you want.   Good Luck.   am --  Alexander M. Milshteyn M.D.    CIPR, MGH in Boston, MA.     (617)724-9507 Vox  (617)726-7830 Fax
