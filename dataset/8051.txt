From: Clarke@bdrc.bd.com (Richard Clarke) Subject: Countersteering sans Hands  So how do I steer when my hands are not on the bars? (Open Budweiser in left  hand, Camel cigarette in the right, no feet allowed.) If I lean, and the  bike turns, am I countersteering? Is countersteering like benchracing only  with a taller seat, so your feet are not on the floor?  -Rick
