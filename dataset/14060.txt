The problem is, you cannot raise adequate amounts of money that way. The Viking Fund tried.  They did succeed, in a way, but only because of the political impact of their fundraising.  The actual amount of money they raised was fairly inconsequential; it would not have kept the Viking lander going by itself. --  All work is one man is work.             | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
