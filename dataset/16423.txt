The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fire \tupon the BATF agents. If they did not know who they were at \tfirst, then they should have surrendered immediately when they \tdid realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of loonies \tdo not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey \tor what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us, \tthey get their say at the voting booth and if their personal \twants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad. \tIf they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could apply \tfor the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrant \tthen they get to argue that in court. In no event do they get \tto establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend \tthat our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdiction \twithin their borders. You live on US territory, you live by \tUS laws - period. (unless you are a congressman)  \tSure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and \tthe FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and \this core members while they were out in the streets of Waco. \tThe BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a \tpropaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big \tcommando-style assault is proof of that. They should be \troasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the \tother hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did. \tOnce the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and \tfinished it rather than let an interminable situation like that \ttake root.   \tThe FBI also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again, \tthe laws we voters have approved, or the lawmakers who created \tthem, gave them the right to do what they did. If BATF and \tthe FBI are latter-day Gestapo, it is because the voters have \tallowed them to become that way. Waco was pure Americana - \tmilitarist mentality, religious fanaticism and unadulterated \tviolence all rolled into one experience. We get what we pay \tfor, or vote for, and this was the result of many choices \twe have made over the years. do not blame \'them\' - blame  \tourselves. We made \'them\', we ARE \'them\'.
