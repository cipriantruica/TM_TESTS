Second, ESPN is affinity with Patrick has probably more to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week NHN(National Hockey Night) affair.(ESPN-ABC owner,Capital Cities, is a company known for being quite thrifty with minimal overhead costs. it is quite possible that Jim Schoenfeld may be working for doughnuts :-).  Gary Thorne and Bill Clement are both NJ-based and the rest of ESPN crew resides in the suburban CT with a very close proximity to tri-state area. Plus,it makes sense in terms of solid hockey following in the NorthEast corridor(PA-NY-NJ-DC/Maryland). Whereas,in the Adams you have only 3-American based teams, out of which 2(Buffalo and Hartford) are not in Top-20  US TV-markets.  -PPV Mark
