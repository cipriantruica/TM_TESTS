Anyone know there telephone   in Bristol, Ct?    I do find it hard to believe that ESPN does not think viewers will simply change the channel from a boring game....I know I did.  And then, when they did not show the NYI-Wash overtime(s), I was livid!  If I wanted to watch baseball, I could have turned on the Phillies-Padres extra inning game....instead, I went to bed angry......I boycotted ESPN is morning Sportscenter today, I was still so incensed.  My wife says I should not go to bed angry, but last nite.........GRRRRRRR!    --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tim Mavor\t\t   |   I am known by many names.......
