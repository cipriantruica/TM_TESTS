Image mapping works, but not bump mapping.  Here is a simple file I was working with, could some kind soul tell me whats wrong with this.....     colors.inc     shapes.inc     textures.inc    camera {   location     direction    up           right        look_at    }   object { light_source {  color White }        }   object {   sphere {  1 }    texture {      bump_map { 1  gif  surf.gif }    } }  NOTE: surf.gif is a plasma fractal from Fractint that is using the landscape palette map.     \tThanks in advance \t   -Daniel-  *======================================================================*  | Daniel Kennett\t \t\t                               | | dkennett@sfu.ca          \t\t   \t\t\t       | |  Our minds are finite, and yet even in those circumstances of        | |  finitude, we are surrounded by possibilities that are infinite, and | |  the purpose of human life is to grasp as much as we can out of that | |  infinitude.  - Alfred North Whitehead                               |   *======================================================================*
