Because there are about 40 homicides total (i.e. using guns, knives, tire-irons, baseball bats, bare hands, etc...) in Switzerland each year and 850 homicides, total, in England. that is three times worse per capita in England than in Switzerland. Since dead is dead, it really does not matter that 60% of the Switz murders involved a gun or that only 0.9% of the English murderers do.
