Highway robbers have been a part of life since the Middle Ages at least.  it is human nature to look at history through rose colored glasses, but random acts of violence have been a ceaseless part of our heritage.  Overall, life is better now than it ever was then.  it is just that random individual acts of violence have never been historically significant, and record keeping in the past was never good enough to retain them all.
