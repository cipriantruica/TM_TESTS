As i have said before, there is no reliable way to find out the size of the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you cannot assume that the window you are parented to is the window that holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree is until you get to the root will work in most cases, but there is no guarantee that the outside decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).  -- Tom LaStrange        toml@boulder.ParcPlace.COM
