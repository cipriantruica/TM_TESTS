Nothing in between.  BTW, I beleive the numbers on those MB engines are 156 and 225 hp respectively.  The one-upmanship in hp might induce BMW to create a larger six.  Also, the 2.6 190E has lagged behind the 3-er 2.5 for some time wrt hp.   I am sure the Bavarians would not want to be  shown-up  by the Schwabians.  PS- those MB engines have not been released over here yet.  daniel
