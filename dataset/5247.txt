One person had trouble with X11R5 that was fixed by using the multi-screen version.  Here is how our version was built. (You can just copy /usr/local/X11R5/bin/Xsun from farside.rutgers.edu if you just want to see whether this version will work.)    R5 distribution installed,         from pub/R5/mit-[1-4] and contrib-[1-3] on export.lcs.mit.edu   patches 1 - 23 installed, \tfrom pub/R5/fixes on export   R5 Xsun Multi-screen patches installed,  \tfrom contrib/R5.Xsun.multi-screen* on export, 22-Mar-93   Solaris 2.1 patches installed, release 1/update 2, \tfrom contrib/R5.SunOS5.patch* on export, 22-Mar-93  Compilation is with gcc 2.3.3.  Configuration is standard, except that the root is /usr/local/X11R5, per Rutgers conventions.
