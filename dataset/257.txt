I do not accept this, I think it is an unproven opinion, and I think the Round-Earthers are right because they have better evidence than the Flat-Earthers do.  Although I cannot prove that a god does not exist, the arguments used to support a god is existence are weak and often self-contradictory, and i am not going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a reason to believe in a god that I absolutely cannot ignore.  A while ago, I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken, in which he proved some of the wildest things, and on the last page, he wrote something like  Can you prove it is not so?  I certainly cannot, but i am not going to believe him, because he based his  proof  on some really questionable stuff, such as old myths (he called it  circumstancial evidence  :] ).  So far, atheism has not made me kill anyone, and i am regarded as quite an agreeable fellow, really. :) --  Sami Aario         |   Can you see or measure an atom?
