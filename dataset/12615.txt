The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that is been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person is risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, i had be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it is much more common, and even a small increase in risk is significant there.  --  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   = =  General Internal Medicine      |       ...dammit, not a programmer!  = =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
