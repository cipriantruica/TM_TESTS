Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  i am certainly not questioning Steve is claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I agree that foods do not bring on the recurrence of Crohn is.  But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.  Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough caveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically, the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be realized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem. Therefore, anything that does not digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided.  With what i have been told is typical Crohn is, of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:  Completely out - never again - items: \to corn (kernel husk does not digest ... most of us know this :-) \to popcorn (same) \to dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins \to nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)  Discouraged greatly: \to raw vegetables (too fibrous) \to wheat and raw grain breads \to exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it is apparently mostly water) \to greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...) \to little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby is without it!) \to long grain and wild rice (husky) \to beans (you shall generate enough gas alone without them!) \to BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing  I was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this day and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try the ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it is bad, do not do it again! Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the daylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it is cooks more thoroughly - you are mileage may vary.  As with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  do not just take my word.  But this is the info i have been given, and it may be a starting point for discussion.  Good luck!  -Spenser   --  S.
