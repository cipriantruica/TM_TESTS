Call MacWeek is Customer Service Dept. at (609) 461-2100 and quote some plastic.  If you forget the number, it is included in the statement of ownership, which is on the contents  page of the copy I have.  A one year subscription costs $99.00 in the U.S, Canada, or Mexico.  I was told my first issue would arrive in 4-6 weeks.  Leslie Jones ljones@utkvx.utk.edu
