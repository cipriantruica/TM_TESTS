Here is a question:  If most marijuana is domestic and producing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be imported?  >       Of note though ... domestic reefer >\tis now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way. >\tYou cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a >\tgood dollar/pound deal.

Your assumption is that this  low  dollar/pound area is sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what do you base this?           And given that smuggling channels are already established, and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than drugs?  >       All production >\twould have to be local.

Wow, you gotta love the speculation.         As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs does not even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.           i had be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you are virtually guaranteed to get it past customs, because they would have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through.         it is not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.
