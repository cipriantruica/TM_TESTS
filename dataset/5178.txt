From: clay@cs.scarolina.edu (F Rodney Clay) Subject: Slider Position of Vertical Scrollbars  I need help positioning the slider of a List widget is horizontal scrollbar.  I am displaying the full path of a selected file in a list widget.  The horizontal is slider defaults to the left side of the list widget; however, I need the slider on the right side.  This is so the user can SEE the file name they selected.  I know it is possible, because when files are displayed in a file selection dialog box, the slider is on the right side.  Thanking any and all who can help in advance, Rodney F. Clay  clay@cs.scarolina.edu
