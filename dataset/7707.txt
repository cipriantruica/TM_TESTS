From: pnakada@oracle.com (Paul Nakada) Subject: Eating and Riding was Re: Drinking and Riding   what is the feeling about eating and riding?  I went out riding this weekend, and got a little carried away with some pecan pie.  The whole ride back I felt sluggish.  I was certainly much more alert on the ride in.  i am sure others have the same feeling, but the strangest thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides.  From now on, a little snack will do.  i had much rather have a get that full/sluggish feeling closer to home.  -Paul -- Paul Nakada | Oracle Corporation | pnakada@oracle.com DoD   | \'91 R100C | \'90 K75S
