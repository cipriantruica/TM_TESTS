From: borden@head-cfa.harvard.edu (Dave Borden) Subject: Quick Survey on Economic Views  i had like to conduct a small survey relating to Americans\' views on economics and on Japan. The survey consists of just two questions.  I ask that only Americans respond; i have posted it worldwide, however, because I think others will be interested in the results.  i shall tabulate the results and post them with some commentary.  Please respond by email to  borden@m5.harvard.edu .  Here are the questions:  1) As an American, would you prefer that in a given year, a) our economy grows by one    percent, and Japan is economy also grows by one percent, or b) our economy grows by    two percent while Japan is economy grows by three percent?  2) On what newsgroup did you read this survey?  Thank you for your participation.    - Dave Borden     borden@m5.harvard.edu
