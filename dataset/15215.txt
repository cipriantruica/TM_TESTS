Do you realize that your statement says that I was mentioning  nonsense  about atheism? This is hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making, as you have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the first. Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it out of hand.  But, because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English, I may be misinterpreting your wording here. Please clarify: did you or did you not mean to call my statements about atheism  nonsense ? If so, care to back up that claim?  >>\tDo I sound  broken  to you? > >I answer in the affirmative.  OK, then. Start up the amatuer psycology again. How am I  broken ?  >Is it politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group >permitted the luxury of arrogance?     *YAWN* Excuse me, I do not recall any portion of my post in which I called Christians arrogant quote me, if I did. I do remember calling Christianity  silly  and then following that up with information that I was nine years old when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god is existence. I define  faith  as  belief in the absense of any proof , BTW.  Also, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types there, so in answer to your question:  no.   Finally, i had hardly call Christianity  beseiged  in this country. I seldom see Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing crosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I do not know for sure, of course, I only say I have not seen it happening. What I have seen happening is my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people who claim to be Christ is followers. I know that this sort of thing is not practiced by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority who are doing it and I do not see comperable victimization of Christians.   >Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting >atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?    The implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. i am not a student of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and Linguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications I see are improper, please let me know. i am here because i am not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as you seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _do not_ think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see  atheist  and decide it was time to poke at someone who does not deserve your respect? Aw, geez. i am sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high, here. it is just that the  nonsense  thing really annoys me. I figure you should see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to your question. Now, the smoothed feather version: I seek all sorts of knowledge. that is why I came to my university. Yes, I am looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of Christian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view. i have been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely do not know the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists I figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist motives here all you want (hence the  amatuer  psychology crack), but without an atheist, you cannot be sure of even one atheist is motive.        i am hoping people really want to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several religions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I actually think about these things. Instead, i am still faced with the implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only  broken  people are atheist. \tTry it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural state and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they  discovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people did not follow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous mix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions so successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which   breaks  people. it is an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another reason i am here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as  a watchdog for logical fallacies :). >I have a  >difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >about the subject.       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The implication here being that atheists cannot possibly know anything about Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my reaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that atheists are  broken , hostile people. This post confirms that someone else believes it.   > >Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says                                               ^^^^^^^^^^ >he will need to be proven wrong about it.   Well, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of evidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies lack of existence. However, I have not met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a  seeker  if you like, I do not.  _Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say  I do not believe in any god  rather than my position:  I believe that no god(s) exist.  For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve, because they do not actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is confusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and Methodists from an atheist point of view :). This is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in something (followed up by  everyone has faith in something ). Guess what? My atheism ends the moment i am shown a proof of some god is existence. Is that really too much to ask?   >Well, I do not even waste my time trying.   Well, I guess you will not succeed in converting him or me. Why the supposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is it because you yourself are unconvinced? :)   > I tell him that he shall just have to take my word for it. And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that I can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how. I have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that is how i am  broken ? I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you think. All I ask for is proof of the assertion  God exists . Logical or physical proofs only, please. Then we will discuss the nature of  God .  >In response, he tells me he will say an  atheist is prayer  for me.  Prayer?! Uh, oh, we will have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :)  >Good luck, Bob.  And, best regards.  Good luck to you, as well. And, again, I apologize if the inferences I made were inaccurate.   >--  >Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock  >Catechist >gt7122b@prism.gatech.edu   Muppets and garlic toast forever, Max (Bob) Muir   [Note that abbreviation of quoted pasages is not always the fault of the poster.
