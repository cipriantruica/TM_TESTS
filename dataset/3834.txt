From: an780@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Travis Grundke) Subject: New Duo Dock With Processor: Here is Why   Well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face:   Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own?   Here is why- People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor in it. Apple cannot deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a  Semi-Portable  fashion. By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you have got  quadra  power at your desk. On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook is processor in parallel to the dock is processor? Okay, we are getting REALLY hypothetical now...  --  Travis Grundke\t\t    | MacGames Digest- Your   Source for Information, Contributing Editor,\t    | News & Reviews of Gaming Software and the Gaming  MacGames Digest\t \t    | Industry in the Macintosh Community.
