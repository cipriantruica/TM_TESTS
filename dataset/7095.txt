Bricklins were manufactured in the 70s with engines from Ford. They are rather   odd looking with the encased front bumper. There are not a lot of them around,   but Hemmings (Motor News) ususally has ten or so listed. Basically, they are a   performance Ford with new styling slapped on top.  >    ---- brought to you by your neighborhood Lerxst ----  Rush fan?  -- Robert Seymour\t\t\t\trseymour@reed.edu Physics and Philosophy, Reed College\t(NeXTmail accepted) Artificial Life Project\t\t\tReed College Reed Solar Energy Project (SolTrain)\tPortland, OR
