One cannot.  The application may not have been started from a terminal emulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if it does it may be in no condition to be  pop[ped] to the top  (eg, it may be iconified).  And even if you can, it may not do what you want - consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant window in a portion of the virtual desktop that is outside the real desktop.  Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window on a different server, for example.  \t\t\t\t\tder Mouse  \t\t\t\tmouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu
