From: Rick Miller  Subject: X-Face?  i am not familiar at all with the format of these  X-Face:  thingies, but after seeing them in some folks\' headers, i have *got* to *see* them (and maybe make one of my own)!  i have got  dpg-view  on my Linux box (which displays  uncompressed X-Faces ) and i have managed to compile [un]compface too... but now that i am *looking* for them, I cannot seem to find any X-Face: is in anyones news headers!  :-(  Could you, would you, please send me your  X-Face:  header?  I *know* i shall probably get a little swamped, but I can handle it.  \t...I hope.
