On the other hand, for the first few years of his career he looked like Herb Washington. Dan Gladden does not seem to suck defensively, either.  >>>Darnell Coles >he has still around because of his 1986, when he hit 20 HR. Yeah, and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career? it is actually not an uncommon phenomenon, and how long a guy hangs around based on one good year seems like a reasonable question to explore on a racial basis.  >>Billy Hatcher >we will see if he has still around in 1994 for his tenth year. Hey, he plays for Lou Gorman, does not he? OK, so it is eight years.  >>OK, I admit to taking a quick browse through the Major League Handbook, but >>only after the first 7 or 8.

There really are not that many players altogether who hang around for 10 years even if they are reasonably good.
