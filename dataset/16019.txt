From: Thomas Parsli  Subject: Re: My Gun is like my American Express Card    I do not remember the figures EXACTLY, but there were about 3500 deaths in Texas in 1991 that was caused by guns..... This is more than those beeing killed in car-ACCIDENTS! (Yes, there could be that low sentences or high poverty could influence the figures but they are still *pretty* high right??) I also believe Texas has some of the most liberal \'gun-laws\' in USA......   *I* should not suffer because of others.... We all agree on this one, BUT we also live in a sociaty and therefor we will have to give up *SOME* of our \'freedom\' (Note the \'\').  Do you have an insurance?? Then you shall have to pay because of what others do...  Do you buy anything?? YOU are paying for those who return goods, steal or even those who gets a bonus...  Do you live with other people?? Then you \'cannot\' do ererything you had want (burping/farting playing music LOUD)  -What the hell is he trying to say ?? When you live in a society (USA are stilll counted as one...) you have to saccrifice. The question is HOW MUCH.   One state (do not remember which, Texas??) tried to impose a rule that you could only buy ONE gun each MONTH. Think you all know what happened.....  I respect the right to defend yourself, but that right should not inflict on other people.  It seems like you all realize that you have a problem in America, the only problem is that you will not take the car away from the drunk driver, you hope to cure him first.  Hope life comfirms to the standard of Winnie the Poh.    \tThis is not a .signature. \tit is merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith \tand to bring down the evil Internet.
