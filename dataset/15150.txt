Michael and his angels fought against \tthe dragon and his angels who fought back.  But he [the dragon] was \tnot strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.  The great \tdragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent, called the devil and \tSatan, who leads the whole world astray.  He was hurled down to the \tearth, and his angels with him.   \tThe earlier part of chapter 12 deals (very symbolically) with why \tSatan rose up in battle against Michael and the good angels in the \tfirst place.  \tHope this clears it up.   \t\t\t\t\t\t- Mike Walker
