(-:  Invariably, all the arguments from people who do not like to watch baseball on T.V. say the same thing:  the games are too long and too boring.  Baseball is trying to find a way to shorten the games for wider T.V. appeal.  If you look at it, though, baseball games last around the same amount of time as football games.  The difference is that there is  more action  in that duration in football games.  Perhaps if there were  more action  in baseball games, you would get more of those fans to tune in.  Anyway, coming up with a solution to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult. [On soapbox] Yet another reason to get a commisioner NOW since it is obvious that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in Nebraska.
