It is about long term pain, eg: non short-lived. >Why this sudden chance in your stance?  I do not think i have changed my stance at all.  My original stance was that a painless execution was not a cruel one.  I did not say what would be considered cruel, only that a painless death was not.  Now, cruelty must involve some sort of suffering, I believe.  I do not think someone that gets shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much.  Even a hanging probably produces one sharp instance of pain, but it is over so quickly...  >Hmmmmm?

Or, if you somehow managed to slip up, and misstated your  >origional stance, why not admit it?  No.  Well, again I stated that a painless death is not cruel, but I do not think I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  I think that some are cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.  >By the way, how long is too long?  Anything more than an instant, I guess.  Any death by suffocation asphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the gas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  i had say that any pain that lasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may be an arbitrary cutoff, I suppose).  keith
