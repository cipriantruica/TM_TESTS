If the state was to be exclusive, it would not have 400 000 arab citizens.  \tAnd no, I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action.  When someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing to sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  It is not a hostile action leading to war.  >As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace, maybe. >However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish >state, where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of >the land.  Living in peace is meaningless unless it means >living *WITH* someone else, as equal. For a native arab, this  >does not leave many options.  \tOh, you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens?  The arabs who stayed are now citizens, with as much right to choose who they vote for as the Jews.  >Those palestinians who stayed, actually stayed despite of what  >happened, and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless >and ineffective minority. >If I were wrong, you had have Israel recall all the >palestinian refugees (we are talking millions).

There is no reason for Israel to let them in.  >Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it >had to maintain a democratic facade (to keep the western aid >flowing).  \tIsrael got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how is granting citizenship a facade?  >>\tTell me something, Sam.  What makes land  arab?   >How shall I explain, Its a contract between the man and the >land.  Control is not it.

There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel. There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500. Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.  Does that make the land Jewish?
