Could |> someone please remind me of the Scriptural source for it?   it is not scriptural, but comes from the patristic age, I think: something about  amare errantem, interficere errorem , which sounds more like  love the errant, slay the error .  No doubt someone else  will know in particular who minted the phrase.  If I had to guess, i had blame :-)  St Augustine, who seems to have had a gift for aphorism.  --  Richard Aquinas Chonak, norris@mit.edu Sometimes, it is necessary to _act_ as if you believed.
