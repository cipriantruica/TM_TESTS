From: wong@ws13.webo.dg.com (E. Wong) Subject: Help with 24bit mode for ATI  I finally got the vesa driver for my ATI graphics ultra plus (2M).  However, when I tried to use this to view under 24bit mode, I get lines on the picture. With 16bit or below, the picture is fine.  Can someone tell me what was wrong? Is it the card, or is it the software? -- Thanks 8)     _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/    _/    _/    _/_/    _/_/_/    _/_/_/      _/\t     _/    _/  _/    _/  _/    _/  _/    _/  _/    _/    _/_/_/_/  _/    _/  _/ _/ _/  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/    _/    _/  _/        _/    _/  _/ _/ _/  _/    _/  _/  _/    _/    _/  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/      _/ _/   _/    _/  _/    _/  _/_/_/                                                                  user is name:\tEdward Wong \t\t\t\t     Internet:     \twong@ws13.webo.dg.com\t\t  telephone:\t(508) 870-9352
