I have no doubt that God hears everybody is prayers. However, He does things His way, i.e. things will happen only if it is His will.

You just cannot expect to get everything you want in this world.  --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: My opinions.
