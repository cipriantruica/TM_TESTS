Reentry would apply forces along roughly the same axis, but tending to pull the mirror away from the mount, and the landing would apply on-edge forces to both the mirror and mount.  It could be that one or both of these would not survive.  greg --  -------------------------------------------------------------- Greg Titus (gbt@zia.cray.com)                   Compiler Group Cray Research, Inc.
