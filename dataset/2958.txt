Several others here  also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend  extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33  MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the  3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate  appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of  spending money, with the size of today is files, etc, a tape backup is  certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend is PC 50Mhz and VESA  local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2  faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.
