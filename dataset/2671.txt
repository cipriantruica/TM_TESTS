From: farley@access.digex.com (Charles U. Farley) Subject: Help with changing Startup logo   I know this is probably a FAQ, but...  I installed the s/w for my ATI graphics card, and it bashed my Windows logo files.  When I start Windows now, it has the 3.0 logo instead of the 3.1 logo.  I thought the files that controlled this were   WINDOWS SYSTEM VGALOGO.RLE  WINDOWS SYSTEM VGALOGO.LGO\t  I restored these files, but it did not change the logo.  Anyone know what the correct files are?  Thanks.   --  farley@access.digex.com   Average IQ of Calgary Board of Ed. Employee: 65
