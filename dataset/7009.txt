That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live.  If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1)\tignition kill or fuel cut-off 2)\ta flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there is always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing? I hope I helped somewhat.  ************************************************************************ Jason Yow\t\t\t\tHuman Factors Psychology Program Wright State University, Dayton, OH\tE-mail: jyow@desire.wright.edu ************************************************************************
