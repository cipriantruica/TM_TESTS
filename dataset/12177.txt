From: karplus@cse.ucsc.edu (Kevin Karplus) Subject: Re: decoupling caps - onboard   i have used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines. (Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They do not help much with simultaneous output switching--there is \tstill a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the \tload capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground \treturn), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load \ton the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high \tfrequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff \tcapacitors, since the RC time constant is too large. \tWhat I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich, \tbut put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent \tdiff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly \tlines were.  If I were doing this design again, i had probably \tomit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead, \tusing just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high \tresistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with \tslightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for \toutput signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors. \tI had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for \ta MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I \tneeded.
