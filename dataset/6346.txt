From: TTR2+@PITT.EDU (Tod Treganowan) Subject: For Sale: UREI 527A 27-band Equalizer  I have a UREI 527A 27-band (mono) Equilizer for sale.  Anyone who knows this unit knows it is been a recording studio standard for years.  it is a pretty straightforward unit, with balanced ins and outs.  Power supply caps were recently replaced, and I added XLR connectors (which can be easily removed if you prefer, as I mounted them on a bracket outside the case).  The unit is in good shape, and is sonically very clean.  i am asking $225 + UPS shipping.  they are going for $250 generally.  Make me an offer.
