Actually I favor government funded research. It *is* a pump prime for a lot of basic technologies. I also understand the short term value of high tech welfare programs. But they cannot substitute for long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise. that is what is needed to maintain a healthy economy *anywhere*, on Earth or Luna. I do not see that long term potential on Luna due to a bunch of factors I outline in another post.
