From: reczek@acsu.buffalo.edu (Timothy J. Reczek) Subject: Wanted - dialog box to select file(s) for DOS apps    \ti am looking for a program that will let me use a windows common dialog box to select a file to use when running a DOS app.  \tBasically, I have several DOS apps that I use now and then with different files.  They all accept a file as a command line  parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type  in the file name).    Problems are:  \t1) Sometimes I cannot remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager. \t     and 2) i am lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried  several directory levels deep.  \tIf anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this, i had appreciate it.  Thanks,  Tim --  \tThe Net is not organized enough to be considered an anarchy    reczek@autarch.acsu.buffalo.edu
