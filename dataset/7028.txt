No, that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city.  >Probability that i shall be needing more insurance? Unless you have an accident, you will not need more.  If you plan on paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card automatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may cover rental cars also.  Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and require you to initial in several spots if you do not want it.  The credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.  I have never rented from Alamo, so I do not know if they follow this same practice.  >Is the beretta a good rental car? Yes.  It is a compact 2-door, probably a bit dull performance and acceleration-wise, but very adequate.  It will have an automatic transmission, AM/FM stereo, air conditioning, and possibly power  windows and door locks.  Joe    --  Joseph Staudt, Telxon Corp. | joes@telxon.com P.O.
