I bought another (a Canadian) at the beginning of the next season,  and I still have it.  I also have an Easton, that a friend was getting rid  off, after giving up the game.  I find that Easton blades are easier to get,  but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  Watch out for  dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.  In my  experiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks,  but i have only ever broken one aluminum shaft.  I like aluminum sticks.  The blades are quickly changed, even on the bench  if you have to.  On the downside, the shaft will not break if you decide to  impale yourself on it :-)  Ciao, Mark S.
