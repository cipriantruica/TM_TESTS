They >could not even beat the Whalers in two games!  Yes, but as has been mentioned many times before, the Islanders play at the talent level of their opponent.  Since Hartford is pitiful, the Islanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most likely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor shooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders could not hit the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of it.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?  I do not know if that would help, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some light on the subject.  And, my playoff pool is running!!!  Exact rules to be posted tomorrow, but do not hesitate to send in picks!!!  --     Keith Keller\t\t\t\tLET\'S GO RANGERS!!!!! \t\t\t\t\t\tLET\'S GO QUAKERS!!!!! \tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\t\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
