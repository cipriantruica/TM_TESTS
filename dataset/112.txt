Is there some >problem with that?  The majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps. There seems quite alot of incentive for the British to have control of NI, like using the North Channel and Irish Sea as a waste dump (I was appalled at the dumping I saw in the harbor in Belfast). It is my understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water -- it had be quite a problem if NI got its independence from Britain and then stopped accepting the waste. Are you suggesting that British industry is not making profit off the situation as well?   Gregg
