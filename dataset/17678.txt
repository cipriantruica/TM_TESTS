First, the only drug that could possibly be put in drug stations are marijuana  or its derivitives.  Every other drug that I can think of can kill you if you  take to much.  (By the very nature of these drugs, your decision making skills  are not up to par.  That is how it differs from asprin, flinstone vitamins, etc. We do not even allow penicilin to be sold over the counter.)  Second, we already have a big enough drunk driving and alchoholic problem in  this country.  If marijuana were legal, undoubtedly more people would use it,  and that IS a problem.  People use it, get stupid, and hurt other people.  Ryan
