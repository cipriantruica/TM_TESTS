From: behanna@syl.nj.nec.com (Chris BeHanna) Subject: Antifreeze/coolant  \tFor those of you with motorcycles of the liquid-cooled persuasion, what brand of coolant do you use and why?  I am looking for aluminum-safe coolant, preferably phosphate-free, and preferably cheaper than $13/gallon. (Can you believe it:  the Kaw dealer wants $4.95 a QUART for the Official Blessed Holy Kawasaki Coolant!!!  No way i am paying that usury...)  Thanks, --  Chris BeHanna\tDoD# 114          1983 H-D FXWG Wide Glide - Jubilee is Red Lady behanna@syl.nj.nec.com\t          1975 CB360T - Baby Bike Disclaimer:  Now why would NEC\t  1991 ZX-11 - needs a name agree with any of this anyway?
