From: maf@Corp.Sun.COM (Mike Figueroa) Subject: SCSI/DOS/adding a 3rd drive..?!@#$   Does anyone know if there are any problems (or if it is possible) adding a third hard drive(scsi) to a dos pc.  I currently have a 386 pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  2 Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed.  They work great, I have not had any problems!  Well, now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another (larger)  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it to the chain(50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors)   and   run the   fdisk   program   to format/initialize the disk.  That did not happen.  When the pc boots, the  scsi  prom   shoots back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the board[target 0/target1/target2].  All three disks are seen.  When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk, I choose to select another  disk(option  5(dos6)) and voila, it is not there. The first two disks show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is no-where to be found....    ARGH!  Ideas anyone?????  Thanks in advance!   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mike  Migkiller  Figueroa                               | Sun Microsystems Computer Corporation                   | E-mail: maf@Corp.Sun.COM                               \t| Work: (415) 336-2798                                   (n)                                             X-----====(...)====-----X                                                X       +++       X                                                         ~                    \t\t\t   Sierra Hotel, and check six \t\t\t           \t\t   F16-FALCON ------------------------------------------------------------------------
