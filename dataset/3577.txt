From: D.L.P.Li1@lut.ac.uk (DLP Li)  Subject: NEW SVGA card?  Hi, all hardware netters,    i have seen recently on some magazines advertising a ?NEW? Trident graphics card call 8900CL. The ad said it is new and *faster*. How is it compare to Tseng ET4000? BTW, which is the fastest *non-accelerated* SVGA on the market? Any info or benchmark are welcome. Thanks in advance.  \t\t\t\t\t\tregards,  \t\t\t\t\t\tDesmond Li \t\t\t\t\t\tLUT, UK.
