From: Robert Angelo Pleshar  Subject: Barasso - the cheap shot master?  After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as possible), i have really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso is cheap shots this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders). i have also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just as examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens (Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of course he was not called for that. is not kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. there is no doubt in my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. he has also very good.  How about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I cannot remember anymore.  Oh, the playoffs should be fun, Ralph
