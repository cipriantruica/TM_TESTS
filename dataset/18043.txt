Somebody correct (flame) me please!  I *cannot* *believe* I am posting in this thread, but what the hell, he asked for it.  I had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing I was bi.   So what, >90% of everyone else is straight, i had never end up with a guy anyway.   As several people on soc.bi pointed out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships or just for sex) in primarily straight circles.  Nowadays with gay culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so choose.  (About half my friends are bi, and that is just from hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a week, it is not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in bars or something.)  So the available pool for dates can be the same size.  Unless of course you are trying to date a random sample of the US population.  As for promiscuity, i have traded email with Clayton on the topic, and he still does not seem to want to admit that yes, gay males are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they are closeted and cannot afford to be seen in a permanent relationship. Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they have *all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there is going to be more sex.  Or that what is  dysfunctional , what is  screwed up  is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that is what  encourages deviant behavior in gay males.  (also note that just because someone is had 200 sex partners  does not mean they are promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous, but it is quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships, and be monogamous or nearly so...)   --                                                                       ____ Alan Jaffray (jaffray@math.uchicago.edu)  Email, \'talk\' always welcome.   bi/ Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music -- Anon    / B0H7f-t+w-cg+(+)k+?s-vm-h-pS6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+N0178l--+a(+)f-vn-(++)e--+dvb+u+
