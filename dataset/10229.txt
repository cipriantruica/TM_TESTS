They _finally_ started going to the net!  See what happens when you  create some traffic?  Muller deserves full marks (what a player!), and Damphousse finally started skating.  Roy (thankyouthankyouthankyou) was excellent.  Did you see that third period save on Young?  And the  defense was taking out Quebec players in the zone.  Anybody else wonder if Hextall will feel like a dweeb when he finds  out that the winning goal went in off his own D-man is skate?  Whatta suck.  Although he _is_ playing really well.  >Life does not get better than this!!!!!!!!!  Sure it does.  On Sunday when the B is are golfing and the Habs are tied 2-2 you shall see what I mean! :-) :-)  >Nick  -- dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca
