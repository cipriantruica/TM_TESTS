Imagine, the King allowing serfs their freedom if they could live in the city for a year! Times change, technology changes, viable forms of social organization change. While concerns about preserving Western notions of civil liberties in the face of cultures with very different values is a valid one, it is a waste of effort to try to turn back the tide. it is much smarter to focus on trying to make sure that the emerging forms of social organization are acceptable than it iss to lament the passing of the old forms.
