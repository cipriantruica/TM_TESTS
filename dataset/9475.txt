Uh, he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car, and smashing it into a tree, as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car. And the  speeding reported was over 100 mph; reckless driving.  >Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell?  Both of whom had DWI problems >towards the end of last year.  (Two years ago?)

They may have talked >about how bad it was for the Phillies, but I NEVER read anywhere >criticism of Dykstra is character (or Daulton is intelligence, for that >matter) based on this incident.  I do not know what you were reading or watching, but I sure saw a LOT about  that, and about Dykstra is poker games. Most of the writing was along the lines of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was, and how he had hurt the team by wracking himself and the catcher up, etc. ESPN raised questions about his judgement, etc. The print media here in the SF area questioned why disciplinary action would not be taken against Dykstra, and one article pointed out that if Lenny wanted to kill himself, there were ways that would not endanger other people is lives. Then there was Dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it was, etc.  Mike --  Disclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^? exit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save/quit :!QUIT ^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^# ^E ^X ^I ^T ? help  helpquit ^D  ^d !! man help ^C ^c :e! help exit ?Quit ?q CtrlShftDel  Hey, what does Stop L1A d...
