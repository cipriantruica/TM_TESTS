From: mhsu@lonestar.utsa.edu (Melinda . Hsu   ) Subject: Re: The arrogance of Christians  i had like to share my thoughts on this topic of  arrogance of Christians  and look forward to any responses.  In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the \'truth.\'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say,  All policemen are jerks!   i had ask,  How do you know?    Because my daddy told me so!    How do you know you are daddy is right?    He says he has always right!   Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, are not we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if i am covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  | Louis J.

I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there is not enough evidence to believe it, or that there is just as good evidence for other religions.  I do not agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who do not find the evidence convincing.  But that does not seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that is rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there is no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a  historical  religion.  That is, it is based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the  mundane  world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it does not).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we are all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I do not see how else we could proceed.  This need not result in arrogance.  i am certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they do not, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it is got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.  --clh]
