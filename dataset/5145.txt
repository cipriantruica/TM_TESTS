From: deloura@cs.unc.edu (Mark A. DeLoura) Subject: Looking for X Window Server Frequency-of-Operations Data  Hello--  i am currently designing the architecture of a chip which is intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as X.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we have got a pretty solid design currently, we would really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit budget.    Unfortunately, i have been unable to find anything of this sort in the various X FAQs, or X manuals that i have seen.  Does anyone have some type of frequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and things of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself?  Any and all help would be very appreciated.  Many thanks,     ---Mark  ===============================================================================  Mark A. DeLoura       deloura@cs.unc.edu      U of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
