As far as I know ISDN (call it Swissnet here, and it is being plugged in) it is 8 bit 8000Hz (gives you one channel of 64kBit/sec) I guess you should not go below a sampling rate of 6000 Hz if you want to have same quality as on an analog-line. Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?  Greetings,  \tGermano Caronni --  Instruments register only through things they are designed to register.
