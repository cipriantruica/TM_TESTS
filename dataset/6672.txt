It seems to be slightly less expensive than   normal dealer-sponsored policy.    and once again....*never* buy extended warranties....they are a complete and  total ripoff period!!!!  you are better off taking your money and putting it    in a bank and using that money for repairs.  many extended warranties never   or have co-payments etc.       How many people will actually put that money in the bank and keep it there for the sole use of a automotive repair......maybe for people who have a hard time saving money or do not want the hassle of  worrying about paying for everything the  extended warranty is worth it.....for some people it is worth it...others not, and for some the peace of mind knowing you will not have too many unexpected expenses is enough.....if you drive a lot, your basic warranty can be up in a little longer than a year....how many people can make the car payments as well as large repairs....  It may work for some people......  Andrew   --  Andrew Bernstein                                         Motorola Inc.                           there is no such thing as sanity, 1299 E.
