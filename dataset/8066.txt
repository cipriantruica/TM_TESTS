A trained guard dog is not to be trifled with.  An untrained mutt may be another story.  ObMoto:  A local dog used to chase me all the time.  Really annoying.  I  finally started stopping every time he had chase me.  He did not know what to do then and would usually just slink off the road.  After a couple weeks of this he stopped chasing me altogether.  He would still chase cars or other bikes, though.  I think he recognized me when I went by ;-).   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -  Mike Heathman           VX800 - Briar Rose        DoD                 -  -  Lilly Research           T500 - Titan (Awaiting Resurrection)             -  -  Indianapolis, IN         Where am I to go, now that i have gone too far?    -  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
