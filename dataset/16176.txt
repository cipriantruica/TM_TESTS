Shit happens.   Hey, joe -- assuming you are old enough to remember it -- how did you feel about presidential responsibility every time Reagan said  I do not recall   about his arms-for-hostages meetings with the Ollie North gang?  How did you feel about it when Bush said he  was out of the loop on that decision  when he was right there in the thick of it?  Oh, right.   He was responsible in the sense that he was briefed, but so what -- shit happens!   Is that what you said?  > joe.kusmierczak@mail.trincoll.edu --   cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\' Packet...
