From: jimj@contractor.EBay.Sun.COM (Jim Jones) Subject: Post-fever rashes:  I get \'em every time  The subject-line says it:  every time I run a fever, I get an amazing rosy rash over my torso and arms.  Fortunately, it does not itch.  The rash  always comes on the day after the fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold, flu, whatever. It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town, although I do not know if that has anything to do with anything.  Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever: a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever seems to bring rashes that go away faster.    Anybody know what might be causing this?  it is no more than an  embarassment, but i had be curious to know what is going on.  Am I carrying some kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out its competition?  Jim Jones
