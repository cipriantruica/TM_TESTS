From: janet@ntmtv.com (Janet Jakstys) Subject: Exercise and Migraine  We were talking about Migraine and Exercise (i am the one who cannot fathom the thought of exercise during migraine...).  Anyway, turning the thread around, the other day I played tennis during my lunch hour.  i am out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  I got overheated, and dehydrated.  Afterwards, I noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, I could feel a migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.) I took cafergot, but it did not help and the pain started although it was not as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the pain subsided.  This is not the first time that i have had a migraine occur after exercise. i am wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder what triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?). i am not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do (besides get into  shape and do not play at high noon) to prevent this?
