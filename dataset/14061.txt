Could >someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is?  If i am not mistaken, this is the usual sort of precaution against loss of communications.  That timer is counting down continuously; if it ever hits zero, that means Galileo has not heard from Earth in a suspiciously long time and it may be Galileo is fault... so it is time to go into a fallback mode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances of restoring contact.  I do not know exactly what-all Galileo does in such a situation, but a common example is to switch receivers, on the theory that maybe the one you are listening with has died. --  All work is one man is work.             | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
