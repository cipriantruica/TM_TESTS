I do not understand why some people insulted me for those SIMPLE questions! Anyway, I did not reply to them with the same language and I will not, because  1. There is no need 2. There is no benefit  3. I do not have time  to reply to those garbages  By the way, do you want to know who am I? I am not a NATIONALIST Arab of 1967.  I am not a COMONIST Arab of 70 is. Are you sure that you want to hear  my name? I am a MUSLIM FIGHTER. I am the same child who  fight with your armed soldier with stone! I am the same guy who wants to  bring JUSTICE to Palestine, I am the same fighter who wants to kicked Israel out of south Lebonon in the same way of the  1982. I am the son of KHOMEINI. I am honored to be a HEZBULLAH.... do not you know me!!!? Just ask Rabin he knows me!
