Perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that YOU have seen.

Just because  Chaisson barely touched the  >poor sap, and he hit the dasher and bled profusely does not mean it is a  >penalty.   Unfortunately, the instant replay is not used on hits.  At first, I immediately thought  5 and a game  because the hit _looked_ much more severe from an intent-to-injure perspective than it was.  After seeing the replay, i had say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you  slice it).  If Stewart had replay, I do not think Chaisson would have gotten 5 and the game.  >In the second period, behind Potvin, Probert had the puck, and was >going to get out front, and was _tackled!_  I could not believe the no-call.  This no-call was bullshit, I agree. I admire Stewart for letting them go, but Probert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty?  i have never seen Probert whine either (he does not need to).  Now, if Probie decides to put Wendel through the boards, he has probably gone, right?  >I do not remember who (on the Leafs) touched the puck  >on Racine is shot towards the end of the game (43.2 seconds left), but Stewart >called it out of play, last touched by Detroit.  Everybody in the Garden, >including the Linesmen knew it.  Yzerman protested, but Stewart just  >laughed, and really  homered  the Wings.  This was also bullshit.  But once again, no replay.  It was Rouse, btw. i am really pissed that the linesmen did not correct the call either....it is b.s. when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake.    >But, when it all comes down to it, [Wings played like shit.....]  Yes.  The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit loss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the Wings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team.  The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his stick in somebody is eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I have seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he has an asshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call.  Murray should send the tape in.  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out of him.  -- dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca
