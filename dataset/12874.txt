There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill. that is the point, after all.  >>Like youself?

I fail to see how citing results from >peer-reviewed studies qualifies as  bizarrely cracked .  that is because these  peer-reviewed  studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people, they are looking at animal models. You cannot walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans.  Note that I would not have any argument with a statement like  noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its use in humans.   This is precisely NOT what you said.  >Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a >study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.

You know, studies of glutamate involve more than  food science .  >Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the >journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?  So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  i am familiar with the literature, and i have never seen any which relate at all to Olney is work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.  >The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they are amino acids. >Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.  Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it is a essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood.  >Olney is research compared infant human diets.

Goodness, i am not saying that it is good to feed infants a lot of glutamate-supplemented foods.  it is just that this  projected safety margin  is a construct derived from animal models and given that, you can  prove  anything you like.  we are talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here, yet you are misrepresenting it as received wisdom.  >>>Read Olney is review paper in Prog.

You mean  asserting .  you are being intellectually dishonest (or just plain confused), because you are conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other.  Olney is reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants, but that is not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG is contribtion to the phenomenon of the  Chinese Restaurant Syndrome .  It says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.  >>dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com  >Hmm.  .com .
