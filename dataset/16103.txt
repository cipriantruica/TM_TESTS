Every single day I hear >about more people getting killed by gang violence and see some of the weapons >that are being confiscated.  Is Kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an M-16 from an AR-15?  That he can see the difference between a semi-auto and a full-auto UZI?  That he can see the difference between the various versions (some full-auto, some semi-auto only) of the M-11/9?  If so, i had love to hear the details, if only because they will demonstrate that Kratz is blowing smoke.  Considering that one can design a gun so that it looks just like another gun, yet have very different properties, and that that is quite common....  Most kids in my neighborhood were quite young when they figured out that my parents car was not much like Richard Petty is, even though it looked just like it (except for the paint job).  Things must have been different with Kratz.  >Sure it is on TV but why does that make a difference?  No, it does not, but that is irrelevant.  If visual inspection of the outside worked, TV would be acceptable, but since it does not, the fact that it is just as good as seeing in person does not mean much.  -andy gave Kratz a chance to back down on this in private --
