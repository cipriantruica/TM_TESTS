The Catholic church has an entirely different view of Mary than do   most  other Christian churches (those with parallel beliefs notwithstanding).  Christ, by most accounts, is the only sinless person to ever live.  I too, have trouble with a sinless Mary concept just.  As for the related issue of the  original  sin - only Adam and Eve will answer for that one.  My children do not answer for my sins, certainly I only answer for mine. -- Larry Autry Silicon Graphics, St. Louis autry@sgi.com
