All I can say is that I will not consume it.    [...]     In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION    LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What    follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.     [Reproduced without permission]  \t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England, \twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under \tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and, \tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if \ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group \tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and \tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after \tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage. \t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a \tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public. \tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers \tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did \tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not \tnecessarily go hand in hand. \t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining \tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted. \tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the \tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins \tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame- \tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in \tthe amount of food eaten afterward.  \t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing \tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a \thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government \thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing \teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety. \tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and \tafter the sweetener is entering the market have failed to confirm \tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  that is why the \tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with \tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association is \tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration \thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a \tclean bill of health. \t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an  acceptable daily intake  of \t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed \tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take \tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of \taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt, \tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,... \tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams \tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups \tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content \tof selected foods omitted] \t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away \tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called \tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000 \tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential \tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child \tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause \tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with \tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other \taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning  Phenylketonurics: \tContains Phenylalanine.    -Rich Young (These are not Kodak is opinions.)
