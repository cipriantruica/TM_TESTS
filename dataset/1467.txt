From: xepo@csd4.csd.uwm.edu (Scott R Violet) Subject: Looking for code to brake image into sub-bands   Hi all, \tI am working on a project in which I need to brake an image into sub-bands and then work with them.  Since I have never done anything like this, do not even understand the concept of sub-bands, I was wondering if there is some software out there that would allow me to do this.  Any hints? Thanks, --   \t\t-Scott Violet (xepo@csd4.csd.uwm.edu)
