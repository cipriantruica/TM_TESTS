From: sheppamj@sun.soe.clarkson.edu (Matthew Sheppard) Subject: Help me adjust my tappits  Well, just got all the parts replaced that needed replced (sprokets+chain) and notice that engine still taps like it did before. All our local \'experts\' say it is the tappits that need some adjusting so I am soon to attempt that.  I would like any advice anyone had.  I do not have a shop manual but have read about the procedure in Chiltons and in a few other places.  Is there anything I need to be particularaly carful of?  Any problems anyone else has encountered?  I ride a 1981 Yamaha Exciter 250cc (stop laughing, it is tiny, but it is shiny)  -- | Matthew Sheppard  CLARKSON UNIVERSITY  sheppamj@sun.soe.clarkson.edu | | i had rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy.ANoN | | I do not want a pickle.
