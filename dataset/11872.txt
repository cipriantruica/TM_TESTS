Good point...also, I would not be surprised that the components they use off-shore are of inferior quality.  As long as it was properly designed and robust, premium components are used, it should not matter where it is assembled.  >I cannot see why people say the amplifier will not last - not with >  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly >  hot - but that is how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.  An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it is gonna sound. The amp you have probably is running Class-A the whole day.  Actually, i had be wary of excessively hot amps, \'cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way, excessive  heat will dramatically shorten the life of *any* electronic component regardless of quality.  In fact, an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs!  Hmmmmm....  aaron  .
