The Cubs are...AMERICA\'S TEAM. >   Orin. >   Bradley U>  \tThe defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes out of nowhere to contend.  The \'69 Mets and \'89 Orioles are prime examples, not the Cubs.  I root for the Cubs, because I feel sorry for them, but  basically they are dogs.  The Pirates today are a great example of an underdog. If the Rockies and Marlins compete, they will be underdogs.  The North Stars trip to the Stanley Cup finals was a good example of an underdog is journey.  The Cubs have a good team this year, and play in a weak division, they are much less than America is Team.   >  >-- >i am really a jester in disguise!                                    --  Chintan Amin  mail: llama@uiuc.edu ******************************Neil Peart, (c)1981***************************** * Quick to judge, Quick to Anger, Slow to understand, Ignorance and Prejudice* *And********Fear********Walk********************Hand*********in*********Hand *
