They both had automatics.  i am a manual transmission bigot but I have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were better shifters than I am.  And yes, they responded very quickly to kickdown requests.  The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure out which gear I was in.  (The Olds may have also, but I do not remember.)  I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 50 mph when my foot told it,  No I really want to accelerate quickly.   I would still prefer a manual, but I will not delude myself into thinking that I can out-accelerate a modern automatic.  And i am very smooth at shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic. --  Tommy Reingold AT&T Bell Labs, Holmdel, NJ tommy@boole.att.com or att!boole!tommy
