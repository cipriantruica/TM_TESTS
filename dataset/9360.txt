The only category that I see which shows an advantage >for Alomar is OBP.  Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin. 50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging. That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year, but I think this is as close to a wash as you are likely to find.  I personally do not care much for Alomar is defense.  I do not think he has nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he cannot turn the DP to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming I cannot overlook.  In the long term, i had move Alomar to another position.  If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, i shall be Alomar could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think i had rather have Jeff Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.     --  *   Gary Huckabay   *  You think that is loud enough, a$$hole?            * *    Movie Rights   *  Well, if you are having trouble hearing it, sir,   * *   available thru  *  i had be happy to turn it up for you.
