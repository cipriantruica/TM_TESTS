From: mikea@zorba.gvg.tek.com (Michael P. Anderson) Subject: Re: Temper tantrums from the 1960 is  OK Phil, you are right. So far the  evidence  suggests that Nixon was a victim of overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with a dash of megalomania. After crushing the CIA and FBI who has to say Kennedy  would not have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism?  Unfortunately however, we do not have all the evidence. So far this nation is citizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of Nixon is tapes. what is on the rest of those babies? Some archivists have alluded that there is  evidence  to suggest that Nixon and his cronies, including George Bush, were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas.  Ask your local D.A. what the charges are for the above crime.   And so I must ask you, Phil me putz, when all this shit finally comes out when you and I are old men, I would appreciate the privilege of sticking a pole up your ass and parading you down Main Street with a sign on your chest:   I was an Apologist for the American Fascist Regime circa 1944 -- 2010   (how has that for a lovely Brecht-ian image:-)   There, that ought to get a reaction. Unless i am in his killfile this week...  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        MPA
