It also said something about being a  polite  alternative to  may.   The presence of  probability, possibility  can certainly be used to partially explain your word selection.   So, i had say to all extents and purposes,  Yes, you might.   In fact, you did. (Not that you were asking *me* specifically.)  \tThe next question is, why would a mailing list be  more  appropriate? We do not all get mailing lists.  We surely do not all get mailing lists about the teams about which we are most enthused.  So it seems to me r.s.baseball is an appropriate place to look for information about teams one does not necessarily follow day-to-day.  \tThis is not intended as flamage, but rather is an attempted answer, as you posed your post as a question. --  it bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait ba a                                                                    i b              Anyone for lemur sooshi?                              t     that is sushi.
