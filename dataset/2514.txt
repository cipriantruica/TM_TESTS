From: bca@ece.cmu.edu (Brian C. Anderson) Subject: Trnasfering binary files from Terminal to UNIX   \ti am attempting to transfer files from my home computer running Windows 3.1 Terminal to a workstation at school.  The file transfer protocol at home is Kermit for binary files.  i am running Kermit on the workstation at school and setting the file transfer protocol to binary.  I am unable to upload files to school but can download files from school to home.  During download, Terminal displays ther retrying message several times then the message \' Verify you are using the correct protocol\'.   \tAnyone have any ideas on how to fix?  Either e-mail or post to this group.   Thanks, in advance,  Brian Anderson    ///  Go Pens - make it 14 in a row ///
