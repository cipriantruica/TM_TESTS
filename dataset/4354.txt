Subject: Computer repairs From:   Does anyone out there know where some one can become educated in the art of repairing Macintosh computers?  Also, how does one gain the prestige of being refered to as a Authorized Apple Service person?  Has anyone out there actually done any of this or maybe even know someone who did.  I would appreciate any and all comments on this subject.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ben Roy--------internet---------PCS(poor college student) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
