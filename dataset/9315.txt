And all I can name is Ron Santo, Ernie Banks, and Don Kessinger from 1969, my favorite Cubbie season.  >\tGranted, the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park, but >that does not mean they diserve the title  America is Team  >\tThe only reason they are considered America is team is because of Ted >Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation.  \tRight.  i have watched enough Braves\' games to know a great deal of their players.  I like many of their players.  The only Cubs games I get to see while living in New York are those against the Mets, and they put me to sleep because, face it, watching guys like Rick Sutcliffe and Luis Salazar does not put me at the edge of my chair.u  >\ti shall consider Toronto AMerica is team before the Braves  \tActually, I notice a lot of anti-Toronto sentiment here in the States.  Partly because of some of that post-Series arrogance (thanks in part to  Upside-Down Flag  dork posts), partly because Roberto Alomar is about as exciting as Swiss Cheese, and partly because, living in  Baltimore during the winters, i have become so fond of O is fans (especially those who call in to Rex Barney is radio show) that I have to side against their most hated rivals. >  >\tGO REDS!  \tSorry, but METS is spelled with an  M  and a  T .... =)   Jason A.
