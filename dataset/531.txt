Not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible, excitable  and easily led from some concrete cause.   In that case we would also  have to discuss if that concrete cause, rather than atheism, was the  factor that caused their subsequent behaviour.  i am not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour - merely that it is not relevant to the definition of atheism, which is \'lack of belief in  gods\'.     --  Frank O\'Dwyer                                  \'i am not hatching That\' odwyer@sse.ie                                  from  Hens ,  by Evelyn Conlon
