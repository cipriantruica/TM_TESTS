First of all, even if you identify yourself as completely Jewish that does not rule out the possibility that you are a self-hating anti-semite.  One can always find Jews who are uncomfortable with their identities (since they only want Jews to be cowering victims) and are willing to speak up for their enemies.  Secondly, the strength or weakness of your arguments does not depend on your identity.  -Adam Schwartz (not affraid to sign my name).
