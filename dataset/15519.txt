God is experience of time is so completely different from our own, since He is both within and without it.  Using words like  foreknowledge  and  predestination  are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing God is perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and ending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no  before  when He did not know, so he could not have  foreknowledge  of our lives or a time when he could have  predestined  our actions.  In fact, since our understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our free will interacts with God is control of the universe.
