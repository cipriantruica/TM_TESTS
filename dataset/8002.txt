Even the DoD might object to him joining, who knows?  If he had a history of such things, why was it not mentioned in the article, and why did they present the irrelevant detail of where he got his drinking money from?  I cannot say exactly who is at fault here, but from where I sit is looks like we are seeing the results either of the law going way out of hand or of shoddy journalism.  If the law wants to attach strings to how you spend a settlement, they should put the money in trust.  They do not, so I would assume it is perfectly legitimate to drink it away, though I would not spend it that way myself.  -- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)
