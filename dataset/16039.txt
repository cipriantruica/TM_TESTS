The House Document Room can be reached at +1 202 225 3456.  You need to  have the number of the document you want (e.g. HR1036) and they will be happy to send it to you.  Tell them if it is going to be a big stack, because the surly sounding guy who answers is scrawling in a really awful hand on the back of the envelope that will come and will run out of room quickly if you do not tell him.  The Senate document room is too important to deal with the likes of you and I, and will answer requests from off the hill only by mail.   --  Laird P.
