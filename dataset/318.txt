Gregg, i am really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice things are not quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim them to be upsets you, but exactly who is being childish here is  open to question.  BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank - what will someone bet me they were not  real  Islamic owners and operators? - and yet it actually turned out to be a long-running and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often quite naive depositors.  And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into BCCI rather than the nasty interest-motivated western bank down the street?   Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned  and operated bank could not possibly cheat them?   So please do not try to con us into thinking that it will all  work out right next time.  jon.
