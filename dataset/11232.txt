There are millions of Macintosh users who have no idea what is in Apple is patented ROMs. Many have modems connected. How do you know all your business secrets are not being stolen? Answer: 1.

In the Clipper case, a representative body of experts is going to be allowed to audit it, and we will have assurances (maybe even from the President) that other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors. While some may not have confidence in that (I am not among them), it is a lot more assurance than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life.
