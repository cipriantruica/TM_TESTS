From  Answer to Job :  \tThe logical consistency of the papal declaration cannot be surpassed \tand it leaves Protestantism with the odium of being nothing but a \t_man is religion_ which allows no metaphysical representation of woman. \t...Protestantism has obviously not given sufficient attention to the \tsigns of the times which point to the equality of women.  But this \tequality requires to be metaphysically anchored in the figure of a \t divine  woman, the bride of Christ.  Just as the person of Christ \tcannot be replaced by an organization, so the bride cannot be re- \tplaced by the Church.  The feminine, like the masculine, demands an \tequally personal representation. \t\tThe dogmatizing of the Assumption does not, however, according \tto the dogmatic view, mean that Mary has attained the status of a \tgoddess, although, as mistress of heaven...and mediatrix, she is  \tfunctionally on a par with Christ, the king and mediator. At any \trate, her position satisfies the need of the archetype. [par. 753-4]   : Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology.  Jung made it clear that he was talking about psychology, not theology.  His comments had to do with the psychological _image_ of God and its function in the human psyche, not about the actual existence or nature of God.  revdak@netcom.com
