Price Waterhouse has kept the secret of the Academy Awards for many years, even in the face of an aggressive press. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee has successfully kept decisions from leaking for the statutory period until publication. Even the Department of Agriculture has successfully kept crop forecasts from leaking prematurely.  Frankly, i had trust the above (not the D of A, of course since they might be subject to political pressure) far sooner than the ACLU, EFF, or CPSR which, though not exactly government apologists, have no particular track record for internal security that I know of.
