Gaetz will not be back. there is been rumors he was officially released right at the end of the season when his contract expired, but I have not seen confirmation. It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he was not going to make it for a while, and the Sharks would have to sign him to a contract, which given his problems competing at the IHL level this spring, does not make sense.   --   Chuq  IMHO  Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com    Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ    Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)   San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)
