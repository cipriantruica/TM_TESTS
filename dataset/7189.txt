From: kenw@netaxs.com (Kenneth Warren) Subject: Re: wife wants convertible  And here is my two cents:  The best convertible for the money, IMO, is the Miata. Yes, it is small, but you are buying it as a second car, I hope, so you do not need the cargo room of a big car. it is got enough power for fun, it is RWD like a sports car ought to be (i am gonna regret that :-{) and the top, while manual, operates like a dream. 30 seconds and one hand to lower, and not much longer to raise.  The targa-type cars are nice, but they are not real convertibles.  --  *=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*   Ken Warren             |The secrets of a good life are early nights, good                          |food, excercise, and clean living...
