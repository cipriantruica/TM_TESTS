I have never discussed this with you. I know it is a minor point, but, gee, dude, you have no idea what economic and political principles I adhere to.  But do not let that stop you--you are on a roll.  Just ascribe to me whatever you want--I know you shall choose wisely. After all, I *do* believe in personal responsibility.  > > No, I mean exactly what I wrote--the welfare system of the New Deal is > > wholly inadequate to cope with the current state of affairs.  > Absolutely.

(a) Just when and where have I encouraged people not to be responsible for themselves?  Be specific--but do make up random dates and heinous acts as you see fit.  (b) You and I have encouraged many people to do many things.  How does that in any way make our audiences less responsible for their actions?  Is there a finite amount of responsibility, so (cf. conservation of energy) as I become more responsible for an occurrence by encouraging it the actual perpetrator becomes correspondingly less so?  At what point does the perpetrator become completely innocent altogether?  You know, this lends a whole new meaning to the term  the moral high ground .  > > > Oddly enough, all the unskilled or semiskilled people I know manage > > > to find employment almost immediately.

Man, you have got to get out of Fornicalia--have you considered someplace perhaps geographically distant but politically more friendly to you, like, say, Indiana?

I do not doubt it, but unless you can show me statistics to the contrary I will persist in my apparently dogmatic socialist belief (hey, if *you* say so) that most AFDC money really does--for better or worse in the long term--feed FDCs.                   *** *** Ken Perlow   ***** ***** 16 Apr 93   ****** ******   27 Germinal An CCI             *****   *****   gadfly@ihspc.att.com              ** ** ** ** ...L\'AUDACE!   *** ***   TOUJOURS DE L\'AUDACE!
