There is a difference between  the feds can mandate literacy  and  the feds cannot interfere with literacy/book possession .  >>As far as  John Q.

Therefore, US vs. Miller supports >limited government regulation of firearms.  Actually, the Miller court did nothing of the kind.  It remanded the case back to the trial court because the miller court did not know if the weapon in question was a militia weapon.  (does not it bother anyone that a major constitutional issue was taken up in a case where there was no defense?  Miller had been released by the appeals court and disappeared - only the govt was represented.)  We do not know what would have happened with the reasonable  all guns are militia weapons  argument.  -andy --
