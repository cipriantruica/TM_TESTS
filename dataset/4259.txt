From: orly@phakt.usc.edu (Mr. Nitro Plastique) Subject: *** HELP! Newly installed Falcon 2.21 bombs my SE! (Crashed internal HD)   HELP!  \tI just received my Falcon 2.2.1 upgrade from Spectrum Holobyte today. My SE is running Sys 7.0.1 with 4mb of RAM. Like the instructions said, I only installed Disk 2 (The program...no start up screen or music).  \tI just downloaded Macsbug from ftp.apple.com like it said, and installed it in my System folder. I restarted the mac an hour later, and it  would not completely boot off the internal HD. I get the  happy mac , then it disappears, only to reappear and repeat the cycle continuously. I never even get the  Welcome to Macintosh  message. Norton utilities fixed about 12 new problems, but the same thing still happened.  \tWhat do I do?  \tPlease e-mail to  orly@aludra.usc.edu    \t\tTHANKS IN ADVANCE!!!   \t\tVictor Orly  ; --  |Victor R.
