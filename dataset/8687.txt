Alomar is got a 2.5 year-headstart on Sandberg (he has 862 >hits; Sandberg did not have 862 hits until he was 26), and is likely to >put up better career numbers than Sandberg in everything except home runs. >he shall pass Sandberg in stolen bases sometime in 1995.  Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.  What competition did  Alomar have?  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken, and the same year as Boggs, Gwynn, and the other magicians.  So less attention was given to Sandberg.  Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre.  Besides the  numbers do not count.  National league pitchers are much better pitchers.
