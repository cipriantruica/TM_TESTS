My premise is actually:     Premise 2:  The cardinality of the set of possible observations on Alterius               is one.    > This is clearly contradictory to the first.

There is only evidence for OneOf(Benefactor,Bug).   No observation to distinguish Benefactor from Bug is possible. That is   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   not evidence for Bug, and neither is it evidence for Benefactor. Nor   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as   if there were no Benefactor/Bug (two statements, both would be false).    This is still contradictory. It reduces to      (1): Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to [benefactor or bug].      (2): this is not evidence for [benefactor], neither is it evidence for         [bug] (meaning that it does not lend more weight to one than to the         other)      (3): therefore no evidence can exist for [benefactor] and no evidence         can exist for [bug].    But (3) relies on a shift in meaning from (2). When you say (paraphrased)  in (2) that this is not  evidence for [benefactor] , for example, what you  mean is that it is no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].  Yes, that is what I mean.   In (3), however, you have shifted the meaning of  evidence for [benefactor]   so that it now means `absolute\'  evidence for [benefactor]  rather than    evidence for [benefactor]  w.r.t. [bug].  Not really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I think this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say, in my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions (prayer, your \'Rapture\' example), I do not buy your use of Occam is razor in all cases where A=0.  In my example, one could not dismiss [benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary to explain the dosh.  I brought up the \'one-by-one dismissal\' process to show that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you are saying in this post, it seems you agree, and we are talking at cross-purposes.   (3) is still in contradiction to (1).    Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:      (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1    Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it is either the benefactor *or* a bug  which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then       P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)    so       P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1     (3) implies that       P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.  No, this is not what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with necessarily no new observation (we have already seen the dosh) to change those estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that is precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise  would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.    Alternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds that the answer cannot be known, or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).    As they do when the set M is filled by  the universe is caused by x ,   where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation   tends to one conclusion over the other.    Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we do not  throw out  any of   contrary to your assertion above that we do.  Some people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science. My sole point was that they are not.   > Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x  > where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite  > number of observations. Only in this case do we get to throw any of the  > hypotheses out.     Exactly my point, though I may have been unclear.    You said the diametric opposite, which I guess is the source of my confusion.  I was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.    What i am trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of   evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence, this does not hold true for   all, or perhaps any, versions of theism - and it is not true that those for   which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor.    On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which   be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this  thread.  Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If the razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which means that you are assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we have already established that it is not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over all i.    Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or   non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and   at worst barking mad.    Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous  occasions. You would not be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?  Although that does not, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case   could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).    But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is   evidence against  an hypothesis, that does not imply that observation of   said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the  estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it is still   against H.  No, I got that.  i am talking about the case when A=0.  you are clearly correct when A!=0.   And i am not constructing a strawman (though it is certainly possible that i have misunderstood what you are saying).  However, by any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely, and when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either do not exist, or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this (including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain a fallacy upon close examination.  If that is not what you are saying, then please put me straight. --  Frank O\'Dwyer                                  \'i am not hatching That\' odwyer@sse.ie                                  from  Hens ,  by Evelyn Conlon
