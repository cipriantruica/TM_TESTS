From: ez027993@dale.ucdavis.edu (Gary Built Like Villanueva Huckabay) Subject: Jose Canseco is Swing - 1992 vs. 1986.  Was going over some videos last night.....  Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting.  And enlightening.  Here is my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep \'92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986.  1.  he has bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, i had say he has     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that is a HUGE amount of speed.  3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco cannot.  Also, note that Canseco does not always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they are fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it is hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  What would I do, if I were Jose?  Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that i had never have to work again, i had restructure my entire swing.  First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.  Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park.  If Canseco is open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he shall be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could still hit 600+ HR.   --  *   Gary Huckabay   *  You think that is loud enough, a$$hole?            * *    Movie Rights   *  Well, if you are having trouble hearing it, sir,   * *   available thru  *  i had be happy to turn it up for you.
