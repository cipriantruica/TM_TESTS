The Mustang is > rated at 205.  222-205 is 17. You have a 17hp advantage over a Mustang   Seems that the 1993 Mustang 5.0 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford  changed its testing procedures.  Under the older procedures, it still   rates closer to 225 hp.  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more.    And you still have not posted any weight figures for the Mustang.   > Big threat. You are KO had by a Civic, acording to C+D    Yeah, sure, in your wet dreams.  And that is probably where you got   that 11.2 second 0-60 for the Stealth.   >> i shall check C&D is 5/91 issue.

Because they prove me right and you  am not got the guts to admit it?  Yeah, thought so.   > The Sentra SE-R really is alot quicker than the 222hp FWD Sports car. > You are close to the 9k sentra-e. Go look up the numbers in C+D - and > report please.   No, i am going to play your game -         No way, Sentra is are SLOW!  I took a test drive and it took        21.7 to go 0-50!  Why, even the Hyundai Excel blows it doors        off.  Any 12 yr old knows that!  I race and i shall kick your butt!         blah, blah, blah...   let us see ...  yep, that sounds just like you.   Oh man, I just got it!  Beavis & Butthead - that is you!   > Who would buy a FWD automatic, that costs $20K+ that is capable of only > a 15.8 and would plainly be dusted by a SE-R?   I dunno, why did you?   But why would someone pick the Dodge Stealth RT over the Nissan Sentra?  All it takes is one look.     TRAVIS
