Reading all you folks things to do to illegally parked cars made me wonder who has going to carry cinder blocks on a bike(?!?!?) or is  ready to do serious damage (key carvings etc.) to a cage.  Then I had an idea--chain lube is not just for chain is anymore!!!  It seems more reasonable to me, no permanent damage but lots of work to get off!  (do not ask me how I know :)  Use it anywhere, the windshield, the door handles, in the keyhole, etc.  What a nasty mood i am in. it is raining again...   _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________ |                                                              | | Ken Snyder              ms/loc: 330 / UN2                    | | Hewlett-Packard Co.
