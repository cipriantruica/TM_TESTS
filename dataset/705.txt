There is a guy running around in Switzerland who claims to have been conceived similarly. His mother says the same. His father is said to be a bit surprised.   But anyway, there have been a lot of Messiahs, and many have had a similar story about their birth. Or their death. A list of Messiahs could be quite interesting.     >- would not you feel bad if you turned out to be wrong and the conception of >Christ was via God?

And the whole question is absurd.   would not you feel bad if you had find out that stones are sentient, and that you have stepped on them all your life? And would not you feel bad when you had see the proof that Jesus was just a plot of Satan?     >- If they wanted to save image they could have done what Joseph planned to >do in the first place - have a quite wedding and an equally quite divorce, >(I think it was quite easy to do under Jewish law).

It is like  thanks for reading this far  on the end of a letter. Most religions claim that they will not fizzle because they contain some eternal truth. So does Christianity. Since there are old religions it is no wonder to find old religions that have it that they would last.   Roll twelve dice. Calculate the chance for the result. Argue that there must be something special about the result because an event with a chance of 1/(6**12) could hardly happen by chance only. Feel elevated because you have participated in letting that special event take place.    Benedikt
