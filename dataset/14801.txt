If I believed in the God of the bible I would be very fearful of making this statement. does not it say those who judge will be judged by the same measure?   >Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for >motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  > Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.   A God who must motivate through fear is not a God worthy of worship. If the God Jesus spoke of did indeed exist he would not need hell to convince people to worship him.  >Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of >it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We do not tell people anymore, that >there is such a thing as sin or that there is such a place as hell.    It was the myth of hell that made me finally realize that the whole thing was untrue. If it had not been for hell I would still be a believer today. The myth of hell made me realize that if there was a God that he was not the all knowing and all good God he claimed to be. Why should I take such a being at his word, even if there was evidence for his existance?  --  ------          Join the Pythagorean Reform Church!               .      /        Repent of your evil irrational numbers             . .     /   and bean eating ways.
