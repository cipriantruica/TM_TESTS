From: oueichek@imag.fr (Ibaa Oueichek) Subject: Help identifying this card  \tI have an Ethernet card that i took out off an old LC. The card \tis manufactured by Asante. On it i can read: \t Asante Tech, inc. Copyright 1991. MACCON + LC REV.B . \tThe card has an fpu socket on it. It provides thin Ethernet connector \tand there is another connector on it which resembels to phone connectors.  \tMy questions are: \t- Will this card work on any other model than LC-serie ?, given that \tit is a PDS card, will it work with the IIsi PDS slot ?. I think there \tmay be a probleme because the LC has 16 bit wide slots.  \t- what is that other conncetor on the card ?.  \t_ Is anyone interested in it ?. I can ship it to any CEE country.   -- Sham(u) ya tha (s)seif(u) lam yaghib(i) | Ibaa Oueichek. oueichek@imag.imag.fr     Ya jamal(al) majd(i) fi(l) kutub(i) |Lab de Genie Informatique (LGI).
