From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (Clinton/Gore \'92) Subject: CLINTON: Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos 4.14.93                                 THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                  April 14, 1993                                PRESS BRIEFING                        BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS                             The Briefing Room   12:40 P.M. EDT \t      \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess i am just prepared to take  questions today. \t      \t     Q\t  George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton  administration is policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the  United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that  the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has  said that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously,  this is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs do not  come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we will look  seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime,  we are going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in  the U.N.  we are going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the  negotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something  the President certainly will consider if the Serbs do not come to the  table. \t      \t     Q\t  How much longer are you going to give them to come  to the table, George? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  we are working on that right now. \t      \t     Q\t  it is been a long time. \t      \t     Q\t  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value  added tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by  reporters, he said -- quote --  That is a radical change in the tax  system of the United States.  it is something I think we may have to  look at in the years ahead.   Questioned again about it later he  says,  It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we  start considering it, i shall tell you.   It was not a trial balloon or  anything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a  question.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote - -  Certainly we are looking at a VAT.   what is gone on? \t      \t     Q\t  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is  reviewing a number of options.  They have not made any decisions yet.   And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we are not  going to comment on decisions that have not been made. \t      \t     Q\t  But you have also said from this podium time and  time again -- \t      \t     Q\t  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.   \t      \t     Q\t     that that was not under consideration. \t      \t     Q\t  Yes.  Clinton says,  It is not something that is  now under consideration.   Is that no longer true? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms.  Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been  made of any kind. \t      \t     Q\t  Well, I know.  But he said he had tell us about it if  it was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he  did not tell us about it or -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under  consideration or if it was something to be proposed? \t      \t     Q\t   If we start considering i shall tell you.  \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it is something to be proposed? \t      \t     Q\t   If we start considering it, i shall tell you.    that is a direct quote. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a  number of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.   The President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the  proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and  cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform  the health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have  looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of  different proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions. \t      \t     Q\t  Well, is the President aware of their consideration  of this option? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know if he has been briefed  on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task  force on this specific proposal of any kind.  I do not know that  that is gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with  the task force a very wide range of decisions and I do not believe  that that is been presented to him, no. \t      \t     Q\t  Well, he has not relying on the USA Today to tell him  what his task force is considering in the way of taxes. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he has going through it in a very  deliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be  made.  I do not know that this proposal has reached that decision- making point. \t      \t     Q\t  If this is still under consideration, that is a  change, at least from what we have been told by Dee Dee, I think about  three weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking  about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I  remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that  not the case? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I do not know if this has  been presented to the President as something that is being looked at  at some level in the task force. \t      \t     Q\t  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other  options that you have kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled  out. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is  being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean,  it does not -- it is not necessarily material until you get to the  decision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of  different options. \t      \t     Q\t  If it was ruled out before and it is not ruled out  now, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no? \t      \t     Q\t  When a guy says in February -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are  looking at the widest possible range of options. \t      \t     Q\t  So something is changed.  They were not looking at it  before; they are looking at it now. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I do not know if the working  groups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide  net. \t      \t     Q\t  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able  to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now  are saying that, in fact, it is being considered? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are  looking at a wide range of options.  They have not -- \t      \t     Q\t  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly  ruled it out on several occasions in the past month? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not deny that -- I mean, those  are the President is words.  Those are very clear. \t      \t     Q\t  Subsequent to the President is words, do you deny  that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled  it out? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know about the timing.  I  think what we did was refer back to the President is words and say  they stand. \t      \t     Q\t  So do not they stand any longer? \t      \t     Q\t  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five  years it was ruled out. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President  did say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate  track, and as I said, I do not believe -- \t      \t     Q\t  Separate from the President? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not believe this has been  presented to the President. \t      \t     Q\t  Are they considering something that the President  -- \t      \t     Q\t  Has ruled out? \t      \t     Q\t     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President  consider a VAT tax? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not  presented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of  options.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly  listen to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it. \t      \t     Q\t  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in  Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax  system.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it  might be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the  case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess i am not sure exactly what  you are asking. \t      \t     Q\t  He talked about the VAT in the context of a  restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health  care, for example. \t      \t     Q\t  Or anything else. \t      \t     Q\t  Or anything else. \t      \t     Q\t  It was always in the context of substituting for  other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right. \t      \t     Q\t  Has that change, too? \t      \t     Q\t  Is that still his view? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not spoken about those  specific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the  working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes,  they have. \t      \t     Q\t  Certainly we are looking at a VAT, she said. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility  of a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a  decision?  No, he has not. \t      \t     Q\t  What kind of a deal do you have when you have got the  President is appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his  ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line  reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has  specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then  goes ahead and announces that that is what they are looking at?  Is the  President concerned about that sort of thing? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President is  concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal  possible.  he has concerned with making sure that they have the most  thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the  different alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with  something like that it is certainly something the President will  explain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those  lines. \t      \t     Q\t  What does it mean exactly, though, when the  President rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the  table later if a more persuasive argument is made? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  that is just -- that is indisputably  true.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He  has not made a proposal. \t      \t     Q\t  What makes him open to it now when he was not open  to it before? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  he has certainly willing to listen to  the argument. \t      \t     Q\t  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a  short-term tax this year, and he was not willing to listen to it in  Chilicothe?  he has now open to it -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was  that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not  something he was proposing, not something he was floating. \t      \t     Q\t  Not something he was considering.  Those are his  words --  it is not something that is now under consideration.  If we  start considering it, i shall tell you.   you are now acknowledging, are  you not, that it is under consideration and -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  i am acknowledging that the task  force has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the  President has not made a decision on it. \t      \t     Q\t  But the door is open for the President to  reconsider including this as part of -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are  looking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you know if they will make a presentation on  behalf of the VAT to him? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know that.  I assume that  if -- I do not know what stage they are it in proposing.  I do not know  that they are going to make the conclusion that this is something they  should present to him.  I know this is something the working groups  are looking at. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you understand, George, that none of us are  asking these questions in context of a decision that the President  has made, only about what the President is considering? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am  acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a  VAT. \t      \t     Q\t  And the President will consider it? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the  argument if it is presented to him. \t      \t     Q\t  Does that mean the President -- that working groups  think that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.) \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working  groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible. \t      \t     Q\t  George, can I ask you another question about  Bosnia? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.) \t      \t     Q\t  No, he wants us to stay on this. \t      \t     Q\t  let us do gays in the military.  (Laughter.) \t      \t     Q\t  No, he got out of that swamp. \t      \t     Q\t  I think we have gotten the bottom line on that VAT.   Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said  that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked  out -- quote --  We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the  arms embargo together with our allies.   That seems to go a bit  further than what you have just said -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just  said. \t      \t     Q\t  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept  what Reggie -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that  this is something that is under consideration.  It is something he  will consider if the current actions do not bring the Serbs to the  table. \t      \t     Q\t  is not there some kind of timetable here?   \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  there is  going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days. \t      \t     Q\t  that is on sanctions, that is on tightening the  sanctions. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  that is right, that is sanctions.   And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope  that that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr.  Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also  working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to  pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option  as well. \t      \t     Q\t  The question is whether there is a timetable for  consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo,  not the sanctions. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on  sanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting  the arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both  internally and with our allies. \t      \t     Q\t  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the  U.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is  something that is under consideration, and this is something that we  take quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should  know the consequences of failing to come to the table. \t      \t     Q\t  Have they been given a deadline? \t      \t     Q\t  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing  and it has not seemed to change the Serbs\' behavior in the least.  Why  should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo  when so far everything that is been done has had no effect on the  fighting in Bosnia? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just do not accept the premise of  your question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an  effect.   \t      \t     Q\t  What effect? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed  our warnings, then they will face the consequences. \t      \t     Q\t  What effect has it had in Bosnia? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on  the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their  shipments through.  We can brief more fully -- \t      \t     Q\t  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it  had? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it is hard to say if it is  stopped the aggression to date.  That is why we are continuing to  press for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we  will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.   i am not saying it is going to happen overnight; it clearly has not  happened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can  weaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come  to the negotiating table, we will move forward with the embargo. \t      \t     Q\t  is not there a working deadline, George, of the 24th  -- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  has not the  United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if  the Serbs are not willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that  we will seek -- have not we said that we will seek -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  we have said continually we are going  to -- \t      \t     Q\t  But on that deadline? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not have a specific date, but  we are going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution,  by around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails  to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other  actions. \t      \t     Q\t  is not this awfully incremental? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  we are taking a step-by-step  approach.  we are ratcheting up the pressure and we are going to  continue to do that. \t      \t     Q\t  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time  all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved  their goals and then what is the purpose? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the  Serbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many  different fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we are  pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through  tightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms  embargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will  continue to do that. \t      \t     Q\t  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in  getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any  campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they have gained?  I mean,  once they are entrenched -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I cannot speculate on that.  we are  going to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  we are  going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I cannot  see into the future. \t      \t     Q\t  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans  say they are going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to  try and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which  show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.   what is your strategy to counter that? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one  we are going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up  the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package  will provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner  cities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point  out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.   we are going to point up the benefits of immunization.  we are going to  point up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the  Republicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or  they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years.  \t      \t     Q\t  Does it concern you, though, that the House now,  the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against  it before.  They made a mistake then; they are making a mistake now. \t      \t     Q\t  George, does it strike anybody in the  administration that it is a bit strong to describe, as the President  did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote --  a  reaffirmation of a promise of America ? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it is the  promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full  potential.  \t      \t     Q\t  Government-funded jobs? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?   Absolutely.  That is the promise of America. \t      \t     Q\t  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday  -- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at  it.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This  will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million. \t      \t     Q\t  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus  package? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. \t      \t     Q\t  Where does that number come from?  Because we have  been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000  new jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something  like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that is when  you do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will  receive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time  job effect, you have to do -- I do not know what the exact formula is. \t      \t     Q\t  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or -- \t      \t     Q\t  One to four because it is three months. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you. \t      \t     Q\t  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President  misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money  for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the  private sector? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think  that there will be grants available.  that is one of the ways that you  pay for the jobs.  At the same time, he has also issued a challenge to  the private sector to hire kids on their own as well.   \t      \t     Q\t  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to  work at Time-Warner? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually  somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  that is going to  be the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where  there would be grants to businesses. \t      \t     Q\t  Has the President spoken with any Senate  Republicans this week? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   No, but there is been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the  White House. \t      \t     Q\t  At a lower level.  But the President has not? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no. \t      \t     Q\t  Getting any closer to get the votes? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  we are continuing to work on it.  \t      \t     Q\t  Anybody leaning your way? \t      \t     Q\t  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting  something of a breakthrough in Aristide is attitude towards the coup  leaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what  impact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to  say yesterday in his report? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.   I cannot confirm what is actually happening in the talks.  I would  leave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has  returned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White  House from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time  again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a  final resolution to a broader political settlement. \t      \t     Q\t  George, yesterday you offered some selective  breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.   Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be  impacted? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states,  yes.  And I think we can get it out. \t      \t     Q\t  Could you make that generally available? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can. \t      \t     Q\t  And could you do it by the component of the  stimulus?  In other words -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know if we can do -- I know  that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I do not know how  deeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into  summer jobs and other jobs. \t      \t     Q\t  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that  Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the  states? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know if they are ads, but  they are press releases. \t      \t     Q\t  Can you describe what those press releases contain? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we are doing is pointing out the  benefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know  that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.   And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package  creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New  Hampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that  this is important.  \t      \t     Q\t  Where are the releases going? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states. \t      \t     Q\t  To whom? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  it is no problem. \t      \t     Q\t  Can we get it? \t      \t     Q\t  Why do not you put them out here as well? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can. \t      \t     Q\t  This afternoon?  Would that be possible? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  i shall have to check.  I do not know.   But as soon as we can. \t      \t     Q\t  Are you focusing these press releases on states  where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we are trying to get as many  as we can.  it is actually quite difficult to pull this together and  we are doing our best.  we are putting them out as we get them. \t      \t     Q\t  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole is  schedule? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it.  \t      \t     Q\t  Are press releases going along to states where he has  visiting? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  i am not sure.  I think that  probably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.) \t      \t     Q\t  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?   (Laughter.) \t      \t     Q\t  George, as the President goes about the business of  defending what is in his stimulus package, he does not address what  seems to be the Republicans\' main point, that you are funding it with  deficit spending rather than  if it is so important, why not come up  with the funding for it  seems to be the Republican argument.  And  how do you answer that? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying  for it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this  package over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump- start for jobs. \t      \t     Q\t  you are not claiming, are you, that that does not add  to the deficit this year? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  i am saying we are paying for it over  time.  I did not say that. \t      \t     Q\t  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the  beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things -- deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But  over time our budget fully pays for this program. \t      \t     Q\t  What you are saying is that there are savings that  would cover this if it were this year in future years? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  that is exactly what I  said. \t      \t     Q\t  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding  debt, it will add to the national debt from this year -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we are reducing the deficit by  $500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years. \t      \t     Q\t  You mean you are reducing it below what it would  have been? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly. \t      \t     Q\t  In fact, you are adding a very large amount to the  national debt over the period of -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we are reducing it far more from  what it would have been.  that is true.   \t      \t     Q\t  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.) \t      \t     Q\t  you are getting to be a grumpy old man. \t      \t     Q\t  George, has any decision been made about the White  House or the President is participation in the gay rights march coming  up in a week and a half? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  we are working on the President is  schedule now.  I believe he has going to be at the Senate Democratic  retreat in Jamestown that weekend. \t      \t     Q\t  Will he address it by phone? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know about that.  it is a  little far out, but I believe he has going to be in the Senate retreat. \t      \t     Q\t  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before  the speech? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know.  I would expect that  at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.   I do not know the schedule on it, though. \t      \t     Q\t  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in  conjunction with the event? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  i am just not sure. \t      \t     Q\t  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President  going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign  the biodiversity treaty that day? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there is been some work on  the biodiversity treaty.  I do not know about signing it that day, but  I would expect he shall have a statement on Earth Day or right around  then. \t      \t     Q\t  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  i had have to check with Katie  McGinty.  I just know that there is been some work done, but I do not  know exactly what. \t      \t     Q\t  When is Earth Day? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think. \t      \t     Q\t  Why is it you know that he is going to have a  statement on Earth Day but you do not know if he has going to have a  statement on the gay rights march? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I do not know if he has going  to meet or when he has going to meet. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not, actually, no.  I would not  be surprised if he did, though. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  it is a working visit on Friday and  the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of  issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and  the trade issues between the two countries. \t      \t     Q\t  There was some expectations that a second aid  package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if  I understand, it has not happened.  Why is that or what is the status  on that? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on  and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked  about the outlines of a possible package.  But we are going to  continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that. \t      \t     Q?\t    We will not then make any kind of announcement  during the two-day meeting? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting is not over yet.   \t      \t     Q\t  Is that when you are going to make one? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  i am not ruling out the possibility. \t      \t     Q\t     the President is going to announce it tomorrow. \t      \t     Q\t  Bentsen said that. \t      \t     Q\t  Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow. \t      \t     Q\t  So did Christopher. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  i had have to look at that, but I  believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of  Tokyo. \t      \t     Q\t  George, has there been further consideration here  about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know that there is -- it is  not something we have ruled out.  We do not have a date set for it. \t      \t     Q\t  George, you all have a position or do you support  Immigration is plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United  States? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  it is the first i have heard of it. \t      \t     Q\t  George, there was a report today about the -- \t      \t     Q\t  Fortunately.  (Laughter.)  \t      \t     Q\t     about the pace of appointments and says that  President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions  that people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the  pace of nominations or where do you stand with it? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President is  appointments.  And it is broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147  noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  i am not sure what that means -- (laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it is  about the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along  farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a  multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect  the process to speed up.  But we are at the pace of Bush.  Obviously  we would like to get these done as quickly as possible.   \t      \t     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the  background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time  than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we are  working on it. \t      \t     Q\t  Is that because of Nannygate? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that is an awful big part of  it, yes. \t      \t     Q\t  In the story this morning, you were at  approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way  behind in winning confirmations. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  that is where the background checks  comes into play.  that is the problem. \t      \t     Q\t  that is the background checks problem?  Because I  mean, you have a Democratic Senate -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that is not the -- you make the  appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all  the forms and have the background checks done.  that is exactly where  the problem is. \t      \t     Q\t  what is the President doing this afternoon, and  what is on the plan for tomorrow? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  he has got some meetings -- just  office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of  issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then  he shall be -- tomorrow we will have an event, probably again focused on  the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And  Friday is the Miyazawa meeting. \t      \t     Q\t  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow,  George? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday. \t      \t     Q\t  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the  Japanese Prime Minister is visit tomorrow? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know about tomorrow, but  we will probably get something done, as we usually do, for these  visits. \t      \t     Q\t  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you  know what that was about? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group  of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty. \t      \t     Q\t  Who? \t      \t     Q\t  Reverend Jackson. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty,  me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan.  \t      \t     Q\t  Talking about Haiti? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban  policy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from  Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he has going  on to Los Angeles. \t      \t     Q\t  Did he request the meeting? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  he has in continual  contact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of  issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it. \t      \t     Q\t  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords  tonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at  all on this?  \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there is been some contact,  sure. \t      \t     Q\t  Can you tell us about the contacts? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  i am not sure --  \t      \t     Q\t  Do you know who contacted him or what was said? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to  him and they just has a general talk about the package. \t      \t     Q\t  And did he express his support for it now, or is he  -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I cannot divulge the details of the  conversation, but there have been conversations. \t      \t     Q\t  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion -- elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care  package.  Is this something the President is considering? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again -- \t      \t     Q\t  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.) \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  it is certainly something that is  been looked at, but no decisions have been made. \t      \t     Q\t  What was the question? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether  abortions will be covered by the President is health plan. \t      \t     Q\t  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your  meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice  about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of  the verdict in L.A.? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the  situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic  development and other issues. \t      \t     Q\t  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be  helpful for the President to go there or not? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of  issues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them. \t      \t     Q\t  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in,  I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good. \t      \t     Q\t     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher is comments  that you are just sitting by and watching a massacre. \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we have been pushing very hard  on a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue  to do that. \t      \t     Q\t  Can you tell us if you have made any progress in your  talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we do not  have any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20  people or -- \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I do not know the numbers.  we have  talked to several people and we have had wide-ranging sessions.   \t      \t     Q\t  Anyone leaning your way? \t      \t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I cannot get into that.  we are just  going to keep working through Tuesday. \t      \t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END                    1:10 P.M.
