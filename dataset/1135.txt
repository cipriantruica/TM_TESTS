I said -> I understand it is a 68070 running at something like 7Mhz.  I am not sure, but I think I read this a long time ago.     Anyway, still with 15Mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for making cool awesome games (read psygnosis).  -------------------------------------- Raist  New A1200 owner   3201280 in x, 200600 in y in 256,000+ colors from a 24-bit palette.  **I LOVE IT!** I do not have a valid address nor can I send e-mail
