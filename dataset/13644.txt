Is there a single Titan III on order?  They have a few problems. The biggest technical problem is the need to find two satellites going to the same rough orbit for a luanch.  They also do not show much interest in commercial launches. There is more money to be made churning out Titan IV is for the government. After all, it is not every day you find a sucker, er, customer who thinks paying three times the commercial rate for launch services is a good idea!
