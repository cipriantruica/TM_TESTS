Blame it on the owner, Abe Polin! This guy owns both the NBA is Bullets and the NHL is Capitals. How dumb and selfish could this guy be? he has unwilling to spend the bucks in  order to get a big star to Landover...no wonder both teams STINK!  \ti have heard that the Capitals had a chance to get Detroit is Steve Yzerman last summer but they pulled out at the last minute. Why? Because our good man, Abe, is afraid to spend the cash!  \tNevertheless, i am still faithful and hoping that one day this devilish dictator will be replaced.  >> Frank Salvatore >> fmsalvat@eos.ncsu.edu   Tuan A.
