From: leighd@syma.sussex.ac.uk (Leigh Dodd) Subject: Help on UK law PLEASE  Greetings all, \tCan anyone let me know status of UK law about riding motorcycles.  \tI used to ride one about 12 years ago and never took my DOT test ( One of a whole list of things I wished I had done when I was young),but I have passed my car driving test. I now travel from Littlehampton to Brighton every day and i am getting PISSED off with the traffic/road works. I thinking about getting a 100cc bike ( do not Laugh ) just to get  Streetwise  and to take my test, then to get a bigger one ( 400 to 600 cc ).  \tNow I have been told I do not have to do the CBT but what will I have to do to get a full licence ?  Thanks in advanced  Leigh   -- ******************************************************************************* *\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      * * Leigh Dodd\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      * * Engineering and Applied Science (EaPS)\t\t\t\t      * * University of Sussex,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      * * Brighton BN1 9QH, UK\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      * * phone: 44 273 606755 Ext. 2616 \t\t\t\t\t      * * fax: 44 273 678399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      * *\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      *  * JANET: leighd@uk.ac.susx.eaps\t\t\t\t\t\t      * * INTERNET: leighd@eaps.susx.ac.uk\t\t\t\t\t      * *\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      * *******************************************************************************
