God makes the husband the head of the house.  But he surely cannot do it alone.  He needs the help of his beloved wife whom the Lord gave him.  At least that is how it is in my house.  I thank God for the beautiful woman He has brought into my life.  I could not lead without the help of my wonderful wife.   --  John Emery\t\t I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart; emery@tc.fluke.COM       I will glorify your name forever.
