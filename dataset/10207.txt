I know it happened in Buffalo, but I cannot tell you against whom.  Krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net.  Malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind Hasek, Puppa and Draper) after suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.  he has been playing in San Diego for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley.  Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.
