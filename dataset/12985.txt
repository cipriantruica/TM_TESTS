FMGs who are not citizens are, like all aliens, in a difficult situation. Only citizens get to vote here, so non-citizens are of little or no interest to legislators. Also, the non-citizen may well be in the middle of processing for resident alien status. There is a stron sense that rocking the boat (eg. suing a residency program) will delay the granting of that status, perhaps for ever.  Don Mackie - his opinions
