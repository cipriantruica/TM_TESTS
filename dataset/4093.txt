From: David_Anthony_Guevara@cup.portal.com Subject: Centris 650 Math CoProcessor option   Sorry if this is a FAQ.  I do not normally read comp.sys.mac.hardware. I am purchasing a couple of Centris 650 is.  I configured the systems as follows:  \tEight (8) Mb RAM \tEthernet \t1 Mb VRAM \tMath CoProcessor option  My purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent me the Apple summary documentation to prove it.  I ordered the coprocessor option, but i am really not sure that we needed it.  I thought the \'040 chip had a math coprocessor built into it.  Has Apple had a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the \'040 chip in the Centris 650? I am concerned that I may have set up a hardware bottleneck.  Please send your responses to:  David_Anthony_Guevara@cup.portal.com.  I will summarize if there is enough interest.  Thanks!  -- David Guevara,    Internet:  David_Anthony_Guevara@cup.portal.com
