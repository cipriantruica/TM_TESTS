In the past, God gave us the ability to create life through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely  cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we will not begin to approach the glory of God.   The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality unwisely for millenia and I have not heard an outcry to abolish it yet!   No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we are not impinging on God is power.  it is only when we attempt to gain control of the spiritual world, those things that cannot be approached through science and  logic, that we begin to interfere with God.
