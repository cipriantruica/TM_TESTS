Any one of the Corel \t3.0 programs).  On the other hand, I have had OS/2 crash randomly \ta number of times, mostly just running it is own applications.  \tFor instance.  Today I discovered a new one.  While I was downloading \twith Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless with the standard \tVGA drivers on a run-o\' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided that \tI wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my  \t.finger.  But since i have learned not to really trust seamless,  \tI fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session.  Whoops, the download \tfinished while WinOS/2 was loading.  It had _just_ gotten \tthe pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop \t(I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while). \t \tBlam.  Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up.  Hm.  Well, I can sorta \tsee the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session  \tand got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were \toff--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys). \tSo I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).  \tPP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer  \t connected  to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way-- \tit told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it \twas _already_ hung up).  Hm.  Well, load anothe--no, bad idea.  \tShutdown and reboot.  \tOk, refresh first.. Now, shutdown.  Yes, everything is closed...  \tHm.  Nothing seems to be happening.  let us see.. Ah, the  \twindows list still comes up.  OK, let us try shutdown again.  \tNo go.  Huh.  \tAlright, wait 60 seconds to see if it is just running slow.  \tHmm.  Still seems to be running OS/2.  Try shutdown again. \tNothing.  Oh well.  Reboot.  Enjoy the checkdisk time.    \tIn this case, a part of the OS crashed not only itself, but \tOS/2 entirely (which is not even smart enough to tell when it;s \tbeen compromised, I guess).  In everyday (specifically _today_) \tuse.   > OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they cannot touch each other or >(generally) anything they are not supposed to have.   \tthat is the idea, anyway.  In truth, when a program crashes on  \tOS/2, it will bring the system down with it.  The programs that \twould just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2, but programs \tthat are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt, \ttask protection or no.    \tFor instance, i am still wondering why print preview in a windowed \tWP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.  It works fine under DOS or even in \ta dos box under Windows 3.1.  (Admittedly, it does not crash if I run \tWP51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard).    >  If windows works for you, >then great.

The only time I wait on anything under Windows is \twhen i am copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even \tthen, not long--I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per  \tminute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it is doing  \tthis--i have downloaded with PP+   while printing).    > and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS,   \tNot sure what you mean here.  OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six \tof these for it is own use (more if you want to count WinOS/2).  \tWindows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the \tdisk cache as I am for OS/2) for itself.  If memory efficiency  \twere a big issue, PC GEOS would be the current king of the  \tIntel desktop.     > some of the >key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it >would be more of an even fight.   \tOn the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence \tthat both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to \tthem.  For instance, the machine I am sitting at runs both fine,  \twhile the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows.  \t(But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash  \tinstall).  On the whole, i had say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive \tthan Windows, but there are (I suppose) machines that Windows \tjust does not like.     >Wittism of th week:  I think that it is wrong to believe in an ism, you should >                     believe in yourself   Ferrish Bueller   \t \twas not this _Ferris_ Bueller?   --  There are stupid laws, and then there are stupider than normal laws.
