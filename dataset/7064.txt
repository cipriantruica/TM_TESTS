When that light goes on, I just take it to the delaer tell them  it is that time  and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor) I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten. Now, I do not have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.    What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and do not worry about the car for another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light will go off.  I do that so that little light will not annoy me.  If you cannot find it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little and good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?  \t\t\t\t- Thomas -  ****************************************************************************** *  E-Mail Address: \t\t  *   Give me an an army of West Point,      * *\tTJZ6624@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU\t  *   graduates and i shall win a battle...     * *\t\t\t\t  *   Give me a handful of Texas Aggies,     * *   Creator of MOT POWER! \t  *   and i shall win a war.                    * *\t\t\t\t  *\t  - Gen.
