From: gkoh@athena.mit.edu (Glenn Koh) Subject: Re: Gateway Monitor Problem--Again! Help   i am afriad that is not true.  The monitor problem seems to occur whenever the 15  Mag monitor is put into 1024x768 mode.  i am running OS/2 at 1024 and the same symptoms appear.  It does not seem like a video card problem as the Cirrus Logic 5426 chip and the ATI GUP seem to cause these problems... two VERY  different cards.  \t\t\t\t\t\tGlenn
