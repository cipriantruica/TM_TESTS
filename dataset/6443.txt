From: pagorm@iastate.edu (Paul A Gormley) Subject: 12  record singles for sale   \ti am selling a bunch of my older 12  records off.  They are sitting around collecting dust and I never use them.  I have used each of these records, once, maybe twice if I did not record the song I wanted correctly the first time.  These records are in PERFECT condition.  Please email me with the records you would want and what you think a fair price is.  I will probably give deals, the more records you buy.  Kinda capatalist is not it.  Well give me a yell at  pagorm@iastate.edu with any comments.   \t\t\t\t\t\tSee ya  \t\t\t\t\t\tPaul \tI have recieved a few questions as to what 12  are.  I guess I should elaborate.  (???!!!! am I that old?)  They are just maxi-singles on wax.  If I am correct most beat mixers still use this form of record.  This is probably the kind of person interested in this colllect or parts of it. Any questions call (515) 294-3737.
