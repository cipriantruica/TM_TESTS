From: fls@keynes.econ.duke.edu (Forrest Smith) Subject: Re: Braves Pitching UpdateDIR   \tAmazingly, pitchers, no matter how good their mechanics, are not machines.  Cy Young winners do not pitch in a vaccuum, unaware of how their offenses are doing.  \tThe Braves\' pitching staff is already showing signs of cracking under the strain of knowing they are not going to get many (if any) runs.  Unfortunately, the Braves\' pitchers were so bad for so long that the organization put so much stress (and I mean *stress*) on pitching that they completely ignored hitting.  \tThe Braves right now are looking woefully similar to the Braves of the mid-seventies.  Heaven help us.   --        fls      fls     fls@econ.duke. s  To my correspondents:  My email has been changed.                       e l                         My new address is:  fls             d f            If mail bounces, try fls@raphael.acpub.duke.edu               u
