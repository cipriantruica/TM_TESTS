From: thompson@apple.com (Paul Thompson) Subject: Tickets - advice is worth what you paid  I cannot think of another subject that generates as much contradictory advice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybody is got an opinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is extremely difficult to come by.  The DMV does not know.  Cops do not know.  Your traffic school instructor does not know.  The vehicle code only tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a wide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any advice that does not disagree with something i have experienced.  If you do not believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code, study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really happens.  Read  Fight Your Ticket  too, but do not miss the little section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you are basically screwed.  As you may have guessed, i am pretty down on the system here in California.  i have carefully prepared for court, bringing witnesses and revealing serious holes in the officer is story, only to be slapped with the maximum allowable fine (plus assessments of over 100%) - the message clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public trying his own cases.  So here is my advice when you find yourself with a ticket:  Take traffic school if you can.  If it is a serious matter get a lawyer.  A lawyer can present the exact same case as you, the difference is the sentence. --  Paul Thompson    Apple Computer
