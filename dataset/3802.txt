From: jap10@po.CWRU.Edu (Joseph A. Pellettiere) Subject: Sigma Designs Double up??   \tI am looking for any information about the Sigma Designs \tdouble up board.  All I can figure out is that it is a \thardware compression board that works with AutoDoubler, but \tI am not sure about this.  Also how much would one cost? --  Joe jap10@po.cwru.edu
