Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2 mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways, however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker is book talks about this. The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of sinus surgery, though.  About asthma, that is a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,  Sinus Survival , *speculates* (and says it is not proven), that many cases of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage (postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  he has had many patients who have found relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated - not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.  Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery, as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.
