You are right, Michael.  In John 3:5, Jesus says,  Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.   that is really what He said, and He meant it.  That verse is the definition of baptism.  I do not have the law book in front of me, but there is a canon law that urges parents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very reason that you state.   --  Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock  Catechist gt7122b@prism.gatech.edu
