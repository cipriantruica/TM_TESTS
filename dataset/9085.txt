Slaught is about as good as Spanky and >Prince is coming along nicely!  Tom Prince is a 28 year old no-hit catcher.  Think of him as a young Dann Bilardello.  I cannot begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of losing this guy, who has been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons.  The Pirates released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options, then eventually sent Prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep. he has another year older, and still cannot hit; why do they think he would not clear waivers now?  Why would they care?  Sherri Nichols snichols@adobe.com
