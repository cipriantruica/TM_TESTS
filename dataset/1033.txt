From: fineman@stein2.u.washington.edu (Twixt your toes) Subject: Anyone know use  rayshade  out there?  i am using  rayshade  on the u.w. computers here, and i had like input from other users, and perhaps swap some ideas.  I could post uuencoded .gifs here, or .ray code, if anyone is interested.  i am having trouble coming up with colors that are metallic (i.e. brass, steel) from the RGB values.  If you are on the u.w. machines, check out  ~fineman/rle.files/*.rle  on  stein.u.washington.edu for some of what i have got.    dan
