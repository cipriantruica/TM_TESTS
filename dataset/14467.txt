If you have got a good propulsion system that is not useful for deceleration, sure you can use chemical rockets for that part... but even just doing the deceleration chemically is a major headache.  we are talking seriously high cruising velocities; taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto orbit is not easy with chemical fuels.  Incidentally, solar sails are not going to be suitable as the acceleration system for something like this.  They do not go anywhere quickly.  (I speak as head of mission planning for the Canadian Solar Sail Project, although that is more or less an honorary title right now because CSSP is dormant.) They cannot fly a mission like this unless you start talking about very advanced systems that drop in very close to the Sun first. --  SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
