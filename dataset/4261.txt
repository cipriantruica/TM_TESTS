The PowerBook 170 hardware does not have a wakeup timer.  Nor does the 140. The Mac Portable had one, and I think the PowerBook 100 had one.  I do not know about the newer PowerBooks, but I kind of doubt it.  I got bit by this too, and it took my a while rooting around on the developer CD before I found this out.
