From: dpiaseck@jarthur.claremont.edu (Derek A. Piasecki) Subject: Ami Pro 3.0 and PCTools compress?!? does not like being moved?    Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 3.0 after running PCTools (v7.1) compress?  I have not corrupted data due to having caches other than PC-Cache running, so that is not it.  The first time I try to run Ami Pro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (I think it was a)  segmentation fault in AMIPRO.EXE right before it finishes, with all times after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module AMIPROUI.DLL at 0002:1147.  I have not been able to fix this problem except by reinstalling Ami Pro.  This has happened twice, with both times being after having ran compress on my hard drive.  BTW, I am not running stacker or any other disk compression programs, and if you do not already know, PCTools compress is actually a defragger, despite it is name.  My system is a 386-40MHz, with 16MB of RAM and a NEC (OEM) hard drive, etc, but that should not make a difference.  PLEASE email me as I cannot keep up with the newsgroup, and it will cut down on net traffic anyways.  Thanks.  \t\t\t\t-Derek  \t\t\t\tdpiaseck@jarthur.claremont.edu
