From: mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Michael D. Walker) Subject: New thought on Deuterocanonicals   \tOften times (most recently on this list in the last few days) i have heard the passage from revelation:  \t ...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes \t words from this book...       \t used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books.  \t I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons:  \t 1.  They were not added later by the Catholic Church; they were \t\t*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture. \t\t(This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason \t\tto repeat the info.)  \t2.  It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrote \t\tthe book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was \t\t** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands!  \tIf one takes the translation of  this book  in REV 18:22 (or somewhere \taround there) to mean  all of scripture , then all of us are likely \tholding something that is in violation of this command.  \tIt is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones \t(they did not like to date their letters, I guess).  I really wish I \thad my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believe \tthat several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have their \tmost likely date of composition in the early second century A.D. \t\tRevelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of  \tDomition (sp?), A.D. 80-96.  Thus it could be argues that we are all \tin sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was  added  to the \tbook after the composition of Revelation, when we are told to add  \tnothing more.  \tIf you want to get the exact dates, get a copy of the New American \tBible.  i shall try to follow this up tomorrow if I remember. \t\t\t\t\t- Mike Walker \t\t\t\t\t  mdw3310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu \t\t\t\t\t  (Univ. of Illinois)
