This is ridiculous, and your doctor sounds like a nut, if what is reported here is what the doctor actually said.  If your wife is pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic, she will need insulin replacement.  That does not mean she is  dependent  on insulin, anymore than she was beforehand--if her body does not make enough, she will have to get it elsewhere.  Oral thyroid replacement hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism, and it is really the only effective therapy available anyway.  Plus, it is cheap.  Taking thyroid hormone when it is not needed does cause your thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone, but that is a _feature_, not a _bug_, and it is irrelevant in any case in the face of hypothyroidism, because her problem that her gland is not producing enough.  There is not a clinical phenomenon of  thyroid insufficiency  caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of prolonged administration of corticosteroids, so there should be no worry about inappropriately  suppressing  the thyroid gland.  >The last couple of  >monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given >some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the  >\'message-center\' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language, >but I have not got many clues to what the english terms are, but the  >brain-area is called the \'hypofyse\' in norwegian.)   Homeopathy is nonsense.  Tell her to stop wasting her money, health and time, and get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make a proper diagnosis and recommend the right therapy.  --  Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer
