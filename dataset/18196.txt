Homosexuals are vicious, screwed-up, often    really evil people.      that is a load of shit.  If you really have the naivete to believe that the   bozos over on soc.motss characterize our entire populace, you need to LIVE a   little.  Try soc.bi, for example...you shall find almost exclusively a bunch of  Yet, the characteristics of soc.motss fit quite well with the other evidence that is available.  High promiscuity, child sexual abuse history, support for child molestation advocacy groups like NAMBLA, S&M, etc.    well-adjusted, friendly, humanistic people.  And, in any case, I think   you shall find that most people are quite different from the persona they   present on USENET.  For all I know, you are a wonderful, enlightened human   being taking the role of hatemonger for satirical effect.      Somehow I doubt it, though....  Hatemonger: someone who reminds people of why homosexuals are dying in such large quantities of AIDS -- because their sexual compulsions prevented them from keeping their number of sexual partners below four digits.       i have got a few clues for you.  (a) i am not working to pass any laws.  (b)       it is being done in your name.      And that makes it my responsibility, I see.  Suppose I kill someone in the   name of Clayton Cramer.  How does that make you a murderer?  If I know about it, and do not express my disapproval, it certainly would make you suspicious about me, would not it?     My morals are not yours.  I would not march in a parade with a group    that advocates child molestation.  It does not stop homosexuals.      I would not march in a parade with a group like that either.  And if you are   talking about NAMBLA, I think you shall find that they DO NOT advocate child   molestation.  I also think you shall find that the VAST MAJORITY of homosexuals  They advocate sex between adults and children, with NO lower limit on age.  But that is right, homosexuals do not believe that an adult sodomizing a five year old is child molestation.    will have no truck with that group anyway.  Fooled me.  They march in a number of gay parades around the country.        Clayton E. Cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer  My opinions, all mine!

Simchik\t\t\t\t\tSCHNOPIA!       Sure.  Whatever consenting adults want to do in private is none of    the government is business.  YOU are the ones that want more laws    telling me what to do in private.      Quit lumping me in with groups.  The fact is that homophobia is an evil,   unjustified prejudice, just like racism or sexism.  You cannot reject all but   one of those.      Drewcifer  It is NOTHING like racism or sexism.  You CHOOSE to be a homosexual. My distaste for homosexuality is because of what homosexuals DO. --  Clayton E. Cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer  My opinions, all mine!
