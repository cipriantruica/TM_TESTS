Clement, although he has a pleasant personality (aggravatingly pleasant in my opinion), is a terrible analyst, because he is almost alway wrong...the prototypical example being New Jersey is first goal last Sunday.  I grew up with Dick Irvin doing color beside Danny Gallivan...I knew did Irvin, Dick Irvin was a friend of mine...Bill Clement you are not any Dick Irvin.  As long as the teams involved do not include the US national team or the New York Rangers, i had take John Davidson over Bill Clement any day.  Gerald
