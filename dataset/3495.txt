But I am pretty sure there is no way to recover this.  IDE drive has mapping information written directly on drives.  When you  low level format it, the information itself is gone as well, I do not think you can get it back unless |> you send it back to Western Digital and ask them to refurbish it for you. |>  |> Jim  Well, I have a different story to recount.  I attempted to low-level format a WD 43MB disk about a year ago.  When I understood my error, I contacted WD. They told me that I had not hurt the drive and that I should just run FDISK and FORMAT/S on it.  It was fine.  Also, I understand that Western Digital is BBS may have some low-level formatting routines specifically available for IDE drives.  You probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop.
