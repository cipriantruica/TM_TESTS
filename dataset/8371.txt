Suggestions?  i have only ever done it in an automatic. I was sitting in my Olds, in the winter, at a light, when I heard screeching behind me. I managed to dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was. i have never had occasion to do it on a bike, but I imagine that it would be even easier, because you could slip beside the car in front. Giving a gander at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch out smoothly when you notice trouble, instead of waiting for the screeching.  i have        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD   kV      got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca                          ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada
