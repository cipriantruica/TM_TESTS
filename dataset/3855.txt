If Apple did not put out such a good product -- i had gladly take my business to -- to -- the 8-bit Ataris.  I think the situation with the Express modem is inexusable for any business. i have had mine on order since January.  Apple finally called me last week -- to tell me that I should have it  by the second week of May.  In the meantime, i have been stuck with my Duo210 without the connectability I needed it for.  i am sure there are plenty of people who can bite back at me, citing all sorts of reasons why Apple is right or at least justified, but i am just a crabby consumer and when I order a  Duo210 with modem  that is the product I expect.  Oh, well.  it is not like it is limited to the computer biz.  Remember when the Miata came out?  What about those Cabbage Patch Dolls?  Well, I want my toy!  ;)    --  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Kenneth Simon               Dept of Sociology, Indiana University Internet: KSSIMON@INDIANA.EDU              Bitnet: KSSIMON@IUBACS  -----------------------------------------------------------------
