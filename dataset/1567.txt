From: eball12@ursa.calvin.edu (Edward Ball) Subject: IBM: Writing to screen memory (graphics)  Can anyone give me information or lead me to electronic information (not books; i am too poor...) regarding programming the standard graphics modes? 320x200x4 and 640x200x2 are easy enough, but i am not so sure about the rest.  Something about planes or something, and writing to ports and the like, but I do not know the numbers or anything -- for the 16 color modes, I think.  If i am wrong, let me know.  Also, 320x200x256 is just one byte/pixel; that is easy enough, but are there any other ways to write to the screen, perhaps bytes at a time, or something like that?  Of course, i had appreciate any information about any mode....  which reminds me of another question -- do the SuperVGA modes work the same, generally, as the normal 16 and 256 color modes, or is not only the mode numbers for various cards different, but the methods for writing to the screen different as well?  Thanks for any help you can give me...  i am developing a screen class for C++ and find myself searching for information.  Oh, I do have Ralf Brown is Interrupt List, which has given me tons of invaluable information already. It just does not go into the screen programming details (except for the read/write pixel BIOS calls...  Thanks again.  -- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // Edward Ball, .sigless Knight                       eball12@calvin.edu // ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
