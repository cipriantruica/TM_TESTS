To Christians, Hell is, by definition,  >eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.   The idea i have gotten is that to christians, Hell is -- like Heaven --  afterlife; i.e, you do not cease to exist, but are subjected to eternal   torture (well, that is the orthodox idea anyway;  eternal death  if you  prefer that). Atheists do not believe in any sort of afterlife.  >  Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since >the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.

I think it is safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly  not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed  metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of  course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview   of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it. Understandably, per-  haps, because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor, then you are one step  closer to turning God into a metaphor as well. --  Antti Lahelma   |\t      mtf@saha.hut.fi \t           |   GNOTHI SEAUTON  Lehtotie 3     -O-\t      stel@purkki.apu.fi          -*-  ====== =======  00630 HELSINKI  | > |    TUNNE ITSESI
