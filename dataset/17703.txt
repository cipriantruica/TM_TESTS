You go read your history again.  POVERTY is the main >engine of social instability (in this context, we will put aside religious >turmoil, mass migrations, etc.).    Well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to  social and political instability, while economic inequality is much more strongly related.  In virtually all major revolutions including England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the  revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term  growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible.  If  poverty (were) the main engine of social instability,  this typical historical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.

Sorry, buddy, but some other  blowhards  managed to include the  general welfare  in another portion of the constitution.  Article I Section 8:  The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes...to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL WELFARE of the United States...   I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they said in the preamble.  >Just to make sure you have got the point, let us do a little experiment.

But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense in Article I, Section 8, I guess you shall grant that botha are constitutional functions.
