Nationwide, the immunization rate among toddlers is about 50%, but     it is reportedly as low as 10% in some inner-city neighborhoods.     I bet more than 10% kids living in such neighborhoods are already      covered by Medicaid.      Here in Massachussets, we have had a universal immunization program,     the kind of Clinton seems to be proposing, for many years (two decades?).     Mass\' immunization rate is 65%.  What about the other 35%?  I guess     some parents are indeed too ignorant or too lazy , or simply do not      care.    > >Sorry to shatter your stereotypes.      ??? > >>  >>    In case you have not noticed, Clintonites are pushing a universal health >>    care ACCESS program.
