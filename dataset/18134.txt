From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (The White House) Subject: CLINTON: AM Press Briefing by Dee Dee Myers 4.20.93    \t                                  THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                  April 20, 1993                               PRESS BRIEFING                            BY DEE DEE MYERS                            The Briefing Room   9:47 A.M. EDT \t      \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Okay, today is schedule.  As you know, the  President jogged this morning with Senator Wofford.   \t      \t     At 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the  Rose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year Award.  At 1:30 p.m.,  he will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia.  And at 5:00  p.m., he shall meet with President Vaclav Havel.  There will be a photo  op at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards. \t      \t     Any questions? \t      \t     Q\t  Is he moving towards some major decision this week  on Bosnia? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  As we have said, he has continuing to discuss  his options.  he has been talking extensively with his foreign policy  advisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders.   he shall try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he shall  continue to discuss it.  We do not have any specific timetable, but  obviously the situation there is very serious. \t      \t     Q\t  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe he has spoken to her today. \t      \t     Q\t  Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly  except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40  p.m.? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He did.  He answered a question about it  yesterday. \t      \t     Q\t  Before anything had happened. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Before anything happened.  He put out -- \t      \t     Q\t  Since something has happened he has had nothing to  say. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he has put out a statement on it last night.   And we will have more to say about it later today. \t      \t     Q\t  In what forum is that going to be? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden. \t      \t     Q\t  He will talk about Waco at that? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, he shall have something to say. \t      \t     Q\t  Is that something we can take live? \t      \x0c \t     MS. MYERS:  I think it will be brief.  We can talk a  little later about the exact structure as we work it out.  But I  do not know if it is something you had want to take live. \t      \t     Q\t  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as  well? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he shall probably take a few. \t      \t     Q\t  Is there any reason why he has not talked to the  Attorney General? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i shall have to double-check.  I do not know  that he has not talked to her this morning. \t      \t     Q\t  And she did not come here this morning to see him or  anyone else? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No. \t      \t     Q\t  And he did not talk yesterday? \t      \t     Q\t  what is the reaction to her resignation statement  that she made last night? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she  answered the question.  The President has absolutely no intention of  asking for the Attorney General is resignation.  He stands behind her  100 percent.  As you know, he was informed about the decision.  He  takes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind  Attorney General Reno. \t      \t     Q\t  The question now arises -- yesterday we were told  that he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much  he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and  the justification of the timing.  Was he fully informed on all of  that, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the  compound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else  was going to succeed, et cetera? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He talked with the Attorney General about  the decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led  to her decision.  He raised no objections.  He supports her decision  to go forward with it.  He was fully briefed. \t      \t     Q\t  Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back  now, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision  he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at  what actually happened? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is  lost.  But I do not think that that is reason to second-guess the  decision.  He stands behind the decision that was made.  He was  informed about it.  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100  percent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the  FBI.  it is a difficult operation and there is -- it had already gone  on for more than seven weeks.  Four federal agents had lost their  lives in the line of duty -- let us not forget that.   \t      \t     This was a very difficult situation and all the  decisions involved were very difficult.  But all the agents on the  ground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving  forward with this.  They thought, given the circumstances, it was the  best possible course of action.  there is just no point in second- guessing those decisions.  Now, I think that there is a reason -- \t      \t     Q\t  Why not?  They have to -- \t      \x0c \t     MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.  I  think it is important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.   I think the President will talk some about that later today.  But at  this -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions,  it is not useful. \t      \t     Q\t  You sound like he has going to order an investigation  of what happened and whether -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think he shall have more to say about that  later, yes. \t      \t     Q\t  He will order an investigation? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he shall have more -- yes -- he shall have more to  say about an investigation. \t      \t     Q\t  What kind of investigation? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he shall have more to say about it later. \t      \t     Q\t  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely  there is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right  decision.  You cannot say that we did the best we could when it turned  out to be a rather -- a debacle. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:   I think we will -- obviously, we will review  the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.   I do not think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.  But,  again, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and  we will take a look at the factors that contributed to that. \t      \t     Q\t  What was the FBI Director is role in this? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting  up the operation.  He signed off on it, as did the agents that were  on the ground that were working with him.  I do not believe he spoke  to the President, but i shall double-check that. \t      \t     Q\t  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of  planning and so forth? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what  aspects he was involved with. \t      \t     Q\t  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House  today? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  there is no planned meeting.  I do not believe  that she will be here. \t      \t     Q\t  She will not be at this event at 1:15 p.m.? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you think that there is going to be a jumping on  on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in  terms of -- to the President is detriment politically? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I would certainly hope that people  would not try to use this tragedy for political reasons.  Obviously, I  think, again, that it is useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate  the facts, and I think the President will move forward with that.   But I think people understand that this was a difficult series of  decisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused  by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four  federal agents.   And I think it is most tragic that a lot of innocent  \x0c children lost their lives in this.  I do not think anybody disputes  the tragedy of the outcome. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling  the, I guess, public relations aspect  in the aftermath?  Who was  talking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at  Justice to set up Reno is news conference, to do all that sort of  thing? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think the Attorney General handled her end  of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the  news conference once there was a point at which there was enough  information, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had  transpired during the day.  Obviously, people here at a number of  levels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department  and at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening  there. \t      \t     Q\t  But Reno said that she did not talk to the  President, and there seemed to be an indication she had not talked to  anybody at the White House.  So who -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to- staff level. \t      \t     Q\t  I understand.  But who at the Justice Department  was handling that for Reno?  Who was talking to the White House? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.  As you know,  Webb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked  to a number of people here.  There were a number of people at a  number of different levels involved.  I do not want to get into  exactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number  of conversations.  Obviously, the Justice Department was working to  keep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its  ability as events unfolded throughout the day. \t      \t     Q\t  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe so.  I do not know if he  talked -- he may have at one point. \t      \t     Q\t  And was the White House role just to seek  information about what happened, or was it to direct the public  information campaign that followed? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  It was both to keep abreast of the situation  so the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice  Department managed its press relations on it.  We were obviously very  interested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the  President was following it very closely throughout the day. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was  following it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet  Reno, why would not he talk to her at all since then? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I do not know if he has talked to her  this morning.  Again, he has kept fully aware of what has been going on  throughout the day.  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.   he has been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning  before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written  statement. \t      \t     Q\t  But would not he want to convey those thoughts to  her personally yesterday? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  One more time, I do not know if they have  spoken this morning. \x0c \t      \t     Q\t  No, yesterday. \t      \t     Q\t  Clearly there is a perception that she was left hung  out to dry all day yesterday. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  that is just not true.  I think we said  throughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that  he stands -- I do not know how much clearer we can be.  The President  stands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.  He accepts  full responsibility for the events that transpired.  He believes that  Janet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they  could, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the  time.  I do not know what else he can say to show that he supports her  1,000 percent. \t      \t     Q\t  One of the best indications of that is to pick up  the phone and tell her. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I do not know whether they have spoken  this morning. \t      \t     Q\t  Why cannot we find out? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.  I cannot do it standing here  right now. \t      \t     Q\t  you have got six people here.  All they have got to do  is pick up the phone. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Helen, we will get back to you. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney  General on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered  or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to  increasing pressure on the Davidians? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.   Again, i am not going to get into the specific details of what exactly  she told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it  was entirely her decision.  She then said that she told him what was  happening and he said, okay.  Does the President regard it that he  gave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think what they both said yesterday was  that she made a decision based on all the available facts.  She  informed him about that and he raised no objections.  Again, I do not  know how much clearer we can be about that. \t      \t     Q\t  And he said, okay.  The issue is over the  responsibility. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He said, okay. \t      \t     Q\t   Does okay mean --  \t     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate  responsibility. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President is investigation that he has  going to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the  administration? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No. \t      \x0c \t     Q\t  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any  congressional investigation? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, it is meant simply to follow up on the  incidents that occurred yesterday. \t      \t     Q\t  And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully  with any congressional hearings that would be held? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.   One that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had  a bug planted inside the complex.  And the other is that the children  may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either  left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.   What do you know about those two -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing more than i have seen in news accounts  this morning.  We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know  -- i am not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by  people who came out of the compound. \t      \t     Q\t  Has the President received any report today in  terms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they have  been able to find out on in the compound now? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he has been briefed.  I do not think that  they have gotten into the compound yet.  They were still waiting for it  to cool off.  I do not think there is much beyond what is been reported  in the news accounts.  But he has been kept up-to-date on it. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney  General Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from  the so-called experts? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands  behind the decision that she made.  It was the unanimous decision of  her advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he  supports that. \t      \t     Q\t  What about the validity of the decisions made on  the ground?  Does he back those -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he has not going to second-guess decisions  made. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the  decision which she made.  Normally, in a situation like this, the  President says, I  made the decision.  But you are saying she made the  decision? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i am saying that the President was briefed  about the decision.  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility  for it. \t      \t     Q\t  But then why do you keep using the terminology, the  decision that she made, rather than the decision that he made --\n\t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated  the facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department  and FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision  and then briefed the President on that decision.  That is how the  chain of command works.  She briefed him.  He signed off on it.  The  operation went forward, and the President accepts full  responsibility. \t      \x0c \t     Q\t  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to  go back to Sessions a moment.  Do you know if this was a plan that  came through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or  with his involvement?  What was his involvement? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Again, you had have to go to the Justice  Department for the specific interaction between the Attorney General  and the Director. \t      \t     Q\t  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He supports -- again, I do not know how many  different ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by  the Justice Department and the FBI.  He fully supports the Attorney  General in this.  i am not stepping away from the Director of the FBI,  I want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who  made the decisions as the head of the Justice Department.  As you  know, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The  Attorney General made the decision.  She informed the President about  those decisions.  He okayed it.  He did not raise any objections to  it, and he accepts full responsibility. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you have, based on what you know here at the  White House, any concerns about William Sessions\' performance during  this -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing to suggest that, no. \t      \t     Q\t  Along those same lines, just in your initial review  of the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come  from not having a Justice Department that is fully staffed and having  an FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status?     \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I just do not think that had anything to do  with it.  I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went  forward.  i am not going to speculate on that. \t      \t     Q\t  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet  Reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to  speak to Clinton? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:   No.  She was carrying forward her  responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.  I  think she did a very admirable job.  The President agrees with that. \t      \t     Q\t  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed  on the situation in Waco? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a  daily basis. \t      \t     Q\t  Who briefed the President? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, i am not going to get into exactly who,  what conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on  the events in Waco.  He has daily briefings on a number of issues. \t      \t     Q\t  No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a  White House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he has briefed regularly by a White House  staff on a number of issues.  Again, i am not going to get into  exactly who briefs him on what subjects. \t      \t     Q\t  Another subject? \t      \t     Q\t  On another subject. \t      \x0c \t      \t     Q\t  Now we are going to do gays in the military.   (Laughter.) \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I welcome it. \t      \t     Q\t  How close are you to signing the biodiversity  treaty? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President is giving a speech  on Earth Day tomorrow.  we will have more to say about it then. \t      \t     Q\t  Any details on where or when that speech is yet? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is at 11:30 a.m. and I do not know where  yet. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?  How would  you characterize the speech tomorrow? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day  speech.  I would not look for any major departures from his past  positions on these things.  But, again, I do not want to get too much  into what he has going to talk about tomorrow. \t      \t     Q\t  On or off campus? \t      \t     Q\t  Is this at a location outside the White House? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.  We  do not know exactly where yet. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President  talked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia?  \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.  And again, he shall  try to reach President Mitterrand again this morning. \t      \t     Q\t  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today  -- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work,  that the Serbs are not going to sign on.  Does the administration  still believe that it can work and that they will sign on? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of  peaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia.  As you know, the  administration is considering a wide variety of options at this  point.  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of  Eastern Bosnia is quite serious.  And the President will meet with  his Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this. \t      \t     Q\t  Is that a question they are going to try to be  deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Again, they will be reviewing a number of  options, including the peace plan. \t      \t     Q\t  Does the group that he has meeting with today include  Reg Bartholomew? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe he has here.  But it will be  among the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General  Powell. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent  encounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating  the no-fly zone? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, I do not.  i shall get back to you on that. \x0c \t      \t     Q\t  Will the President be meeting with every one of the  leaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He will.  he shall be meeting, as you know,  with Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with  the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon. \t      \t     Q\t  As a group, or one by one? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it is as a group.  Now, Havel and  Walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for  quite some time.  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of  state that are here. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he  supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?  And has anything been  worked out for him to address the march on Sunday? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think he shall probably have a letter or some  kind of a statement to the march.  We have not worked out the exact  details of that. \t      \t     Q\t  Not a live phone hook-up? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting  to Boston.  The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.  The answer to  the other part of your question is, no, he has not taken a position on  it. \t      \t     Q\t  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you know what it is on? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  we will still working out -- \t      \t     Q\t  General Vessey is coming back tonight from Vietnam.   When will he be meeting with the President? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.  we will  talk to him at some point and see.  We look forward to his report,  but exactly how he shall make that report is unclear. \t      \t     Q\t  So he has not going to come immediately to the White  House? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No. \t      \t     Q\t  The AIDS czar -- how close are you? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Still working on it. \t      \t     Q\t  Drug czar? \t      \t     Q\t  Do you expect it before the march? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not have a time line on it. \t      \t     Q\t  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the  Lloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe so. \t      \t     Q\t  Why not? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he has just not going to. \x0c \t      \t     Q\t  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, that is tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. \t      \t     Q\t  Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the Senate will vote on  amendments today.  we will continue to talk.  The President is  committed to some kind of a jobs package; we would like to see it passed.   And we will continue in conversations throughout the day and see where  we end up. \t      \t     Q\t  When this briefing is over can you give us word  through the speaker or whatever whether the President is talked to  Janet Reno? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  we will be happy to. \t      \t     Q\t  it is become a pressing question for the last  several hours. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, just this minute that i have been here,  and I have not had a chance to follow up on it, Helen. \t      \t     Q\t  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered  a compromise package of $12.2 billion.  He believes that that is the  best alternative, believes that he has obviously willing to take a  second look at the package.  And I think the Senate will vote on that  today, and we are hopeful that the President is bill, which will be the  Mitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that  will be at the march on Sunday? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the  President.  I do not know who yet. \t      \t     Q\t  Well, has it been decided how he has going to  address?  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think it will probably be a letter, but  there has not been a final decision on that yet. \t      \t     Q\t  The official will read the letter, is that what it  sounds like? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Correct. \t      \t     Q\t  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.  Do you  know what was that about?  Was that about this Waco thing? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, actually it was not.  It may have come  up, but it was about economic issues. \t      \t     Q\t  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the  target? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  that is still the target. \t      \t     Q\t  And there is talk about a Joint Session of Congress  speech at the end of May -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  We have not resolved exactly how the  President will present the health care plan to the people.  I  would not rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made.                                   END10:08 A.M. EDT
