From: abh@genesis.nred.ma.us (Andrew Hudson) Subject: Source to create FLI or FLC ?   Does anyone know if the source is available to create FLI or FLC animations? I would ideally like DLL is for Windows but would settle for C source.  i have heard they might be  available on Amiga forums somewhere.  The libraries currently distributed by Autodesk, AAWIN, AAPLAY, do NOT have FLI creation capability, only playback.  Any pointers would be appreciated, thanks!  - Andrew  Hudson abh@genesis.nred.ma.us
