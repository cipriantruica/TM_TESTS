Why do not we move down even further toward the masses by setting this up on an IBM PC clone(probably needs to be a 386 or a 486) with a  sound blaster and a V.32bis modem.  Those components are very widely available.  I do not know if the PC has enough horsepower to encrypt the data at realtime, but the sound blaster has 4 to 1 hardware compression and will work at any sampling rate from 4KHz to 23 KHz.
