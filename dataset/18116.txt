Sorry, but this is a red herring.  Are you contending that the  mountain of forms  are processed by Blue Cross?  Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee and as an employee of a private corporation, I saw no difference between the two sets of forms.    Moreover, the administrative costs associated with Medicare/Medicaid, the two primary forms of  government  insurance are considerably lower than the average for private insurance companies.   (5% versus 14%-16%).  If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring government employees than private employees, post it.  Otherwise, try to stick to factual assertions.  > >> And as the original post implied, it is private insurers in the US  >> whose administrative costs are significantly higher than the administrative >> costs of tax-supported health care systems in Canada and elsewhere. > >\tOnly those that remain paper-bound and refuse to standardize.  Well now, that is an interesting defense of the  free enterprise  system. Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents  private insurance companies from  standardizing?   In fact, it is true that some of the red-tape burden stems from the  lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US, but it is a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than  free enterprise  at work.    By the way, Barron is, the bible of Wall Street, this week admitted that administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because  ....a single-payer system is always cheaper... .  Guess even the  free enterprise advocates  are beginning to see the light. > >> Try again. > >\tWhy?  My HMO provides good service at a low cost.

Sorry, but you seem to be confusing proposals with health care reform with the Bush administration is gag order on federally funded family planning clinics.  There are no proposals that would control what your  doctor...can and cannot say about medical procedures.   Try again.  jsh -- Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM     One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh  the bulls**t.  - R.
