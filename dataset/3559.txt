If you change the drive you only need to change the bios config. as usual.  >3.  Will it work with a dual-drive system (master and slave)? Yes, no problem.  > >4.  With it, will I need smartdrive or DOS buffers? That depends. You will get a little better performance if you use smartdrive and buffers in addition. that is because access to the card through the ISA bus is slower than access to system RAM. I do not use smartdrive myself, but I have a few buffers.  > >5.  Is the Promise Technology controller a good one? > >Any information would be greatly appreciated.
