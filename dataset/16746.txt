From: dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (David Davidian) Subject: ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES  Dear friends,  I am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee. As part of the requirements for a research class in music education I designed a questionnaire to colect data for my research project. The study intends to determine which techniques (if any) have been used to teach music for the deaf.  If you have any experience in music education for the deaf and would like to help me with this project, your help would be very much appreciated.   If you also want to exchange some ideas about the subject matter, feel yourself welcome. I have been working in this area for a while (in Brazil _ by the way, I am Brazilian _ and also in US) and I am very pleased with the results.  I hope that this inquiry will not cause too many inconveniences. Thank you for or time and consideration.                            __QUESTIONNAIRE__                   Teaching Music for deaf children.

The following questionnaire was designed to find out how teachers face the issue of teaching or not teaching music for the deaf. Also, a part of this study is to determine teachers attitudes towards music programs for deaf children.  \tDIRECTIONS: \tREAD THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND CIRCLE THE NUMBER THAT BEST DESCRIBES YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS MUSIC FOR DEAF CHILDREN (LEFT COLUMN), AND CIRCLE THE APPROPRIATE  YES ,  NO  OR  NOT APPLICABLE , WHETHER YOU DO THE TASK (RIGHT COLUMN).
