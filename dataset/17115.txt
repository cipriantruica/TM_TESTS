Moshe Arens (former Israeli Defense  Minister) was spying on him. \t- Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention.  \tIn any case, who cares?  \t\t\t\t\tRobert Siegfried \t\t\t\t\tComputer Science Dept. \t\t\t\t\tSaint Peter is College \t\t\t\t\tJersey City, NJ  07306 \t\t\t\t\tsiegfried_r@spcvxa.spc.edu
