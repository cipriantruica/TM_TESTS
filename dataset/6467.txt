From: d32x@vax5.cit.cornell.edu Subject: Adaptec 1640 SCSI MC controller $250!!  i am selling an Adaptec 1640 SCSI controller card.  I works with Microchannel machines only.  The data transfer rate is very fast (I get about 3meg/sec with my SCSI hard drive), and that is with relatively slow 100ns RAM on a card.  it is a SCSI-2 true bus mastering/DMA device, and goes for around $329 bought new.  i am including the new EZ-SCSI software for speedy Win 3.1 performance and easy configuration. i am selling it for $225, and i shall pay the COD shipping.  Please email me directly, and either give me your phone   with your offer, or i shall respond with mine.  I hope we can both benefit from the sale of this Microchannel device; it is a great product!
