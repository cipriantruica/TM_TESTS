From: digdug@iastate.edu (Doug V Tran) Subject: Re: leaking memory resources in 3.1  Here is an interesting table showing how much resources an application uses and how much it gives back on shut down.  This is take from Windows User May 1993 issue:   Application\t\tMin.

What does this table tells you, if you frequently start and exit a program that does not give back all of it is resources, then you continually lose these resouces.  Therefore, only open these programs up once and leave them open.   BTW:  Maybe people can add to this list so we know what application to watch out for.   later, Doug
