AT any case, a lot of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to .bmp *will* convert to .rle.  I Know for a fact that PaintShop (shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think, where VVV is the ver. number.  If that is not true, let me know and I ll post a corection).   This, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you have to rename it.  NOW, another thing.... this is from the windows\' FAQ:  your file has to be less than 64 K ( at least that is what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than about 30...maybe they mend 32K, I do not know).  Your file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size is.)  If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a way to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file, such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  i am not sure about this, as I have a vga, but i am sure you could find it in the faq (a windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but do not konw the filename).   ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less.  These specs rule out some of the good .bmp is.  I found cartoon drawings work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little memory.  Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your new win.com in the windows directory.  Also, do not start windows from a directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of the one in the windows dir, and win. will not start.   Share this fairly, but do not take a slice of my pie (PF).
