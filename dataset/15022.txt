From: noye@midway.uchicago.edu (vera shanti noyes) Subject: Re: An agnostic is question  perhaps you can tell your friend that you feel pressured by his continual discussions of this topic -- surely he does not feel you should be _pressured_ into something you feel uncomfortable about (since christianity should be a choice one should make on one is own). please also realize that he is doing this out of friendship -- he probably feels you are missing out on something great, and wants to tell you about it.  but since you know where you can learn about christianity, you can tell him that it is now up to you to make that choice, and if the choice is no, you should be respected for that. personally i believe that a christian is mission is just to be christ-like, showing his/her own faith and happiness in that faith, and make sure people know they are welcome to talk to you about it.  i do not believe in imposing your beliefs upon others -- but then again everyone is definitions of  imposing  may differ.    i hope i have made myself clear....  if not, please correct me! :) vera ******************************************************************************* I am your CLOCK!     |  I bind unto myself today    | Vera Noyes I am your religion!  |  the strong name of the\t    | noye@midway.uchicago.edu I own you!\t     |  Trinity....\t\t    | no disclaimer -- what \t- Lard\t     |\t- St. Patrick is Breastplate | is there to disclaim? *******************************************************************************
