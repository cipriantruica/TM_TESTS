From: chau@hao.ucar.edu (National Center for Atmospheric Research) Subject: Please help! (looking for books)  Hi netters! \tI often have troubles with my PC and would like to fix it by myself.  Is  \tthere any book that show you how to fix your own PC (hardware, monitor, \tprinter problems..etc).  Of course, no book would tell you the exact \tproblem with your PC, but at least it will give a general idea what \tmight be wrong.  Thanks so lot for your help.
