The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among  21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This  report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC is National Hospital  Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years.       Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been  collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC is National Center  for Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were  abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484  participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior  cesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national  estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged  after delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were  calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from  national vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of  cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based  solely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at  the 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value  of 1.96.       In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as  in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean  rate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no  previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5.  In 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p 1:114/15                 Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na
