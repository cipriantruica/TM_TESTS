I bet this one day is worth of games pulled everything back to close to average.  Interesting, because the other day, all but three games had ten or more runs scored, and yesterday no game had more than nine. --  ted frank                 |  thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |         i am sorry, the card says  Moops.  the u of c law school     |  standard disclaimers      |
