From: george.howell%goucher@wb3ffv.ampr.org (George Howell)  Subject: BRONCOS  Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos? (i am not talking about Bronco II is, i am referring to the Broncos that began production in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe)  I need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all models, how easily can that be done. Also, what kind of price range should I be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) i am in college right now, and would like a Jeep. Unfortunately, i have got a bit of a ride to school, and I need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in the spring/fall. I think that the Bronco (with the removable fiberglass) would be a better (read  bigger ) choice than a CJ-5 or CJ-7.  Even better: anybody in the Maryland/Virginia area interested in selling one?
