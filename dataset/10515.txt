I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract.  Risebrough matched the offer on King is request and Makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks. Not to mention that he has lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes.   I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract. he has ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help a team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there is no takers, and Makarov does not show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just bite the bullet and buy out Makarov is contract and release him. With his current attitude, he is a detriment to the team.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlan
