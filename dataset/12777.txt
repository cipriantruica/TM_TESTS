From: black@sybase.com (Chris Black) Subject: cystic breast disease  My mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease -- a big relief, as it was a lump that could have been cancer.  Her doctor says she should go off caffeine and chocolate for 6 months, as well as stopping the estrogen she is been taking for menopause-related reasons. she is not thrilled with this, I think especially because she just gave up cigarettes -- soon she will not have any pleasures left!  Now, I thought i had heard that cystic breasts were common and not really a health risk. Is this accurate?  If so, why is she being told to make various sacrifices to treat something that is not that big of a deal?  Thanks for any information.  -- Chris  --  black@sybase.com  Note:  My mailer tends to garble subject lines.
