Some lucky ones  \tescaped to relative safety in Turkiye. The remaining others are being  \tfinished now by local Christians, the USA, and the rest of Europe.  \tThe Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslem \tpeoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting  \tChristian Serbs and Croats torture, rape, and massacre the innocent  \tMoslem peoples of Bosnia.  \tIt took Christian Europe for almost six centuries to achieve this \tobjective of theirs and I do not think they will let it up. This will  \tgo on untill every single Moslem person (Bosnian, Turk, Albanian, etc) \tis tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes.  \t
