My understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level (or below).  So unless what i am saying is directly related to VAX/VMS, do not hold me or my organization responsible for it.  If it IS related to VAX/VMS, you can try to hold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it.
