If you use xsizehints->flags = PPosition | PSize, this tells the window manager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user. I do not know a window manager that does not place the window like you prefer if you specify the position and size like above.  Greetings from Berlin,  Tobias (bading@cs.tu-berlin.de)
