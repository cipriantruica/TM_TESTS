From: rising@zoo.toronto.edu (Jim Rising) Subject: A modest request  I am finding the volume of stuff on rec.sport.baseball overwhelming -- ca. 200 posts/day.  An effect of this is that a backlog builds up, and many posts get dumped from my system.  I could probably fix that--but do not have the time to read them all in any event.  My guess is that mine is a common problem.  I have some ideas that would help:  1.  Each person generally post no more than one article/day. 2.  Limit the extent to which previous posts are reproduced     in posts. 3.  do not post mindless `woofs,\' or `anti-woofs,\' e.g.  The     Jays are best!   or   The Jays suck.  4.  do not respond to mindless posts, e.g.   Jack Morris is     a better pitcher than Frank Viola because he has won a      World Series.   I know that you can use the `n\' key to     get by these posts, but they bump interesting posts from     my disk. 5.  use the goddamn shift key etc it makes your posts easier     to read  --  Name:     Jim Rising Mail:     Dept.
