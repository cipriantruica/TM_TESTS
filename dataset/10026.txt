From: Robert Angelo Pleshar  Subject: Bowman whining already  I should have guessed. it is time for the annual Pittsburgh Penguins whine-a-thon. Bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the Devils in Game 1. i am sorry, Mr. Bowman, you are a great coach, but those  cheap shots  were nothing compared to what is going to come. Also, I guess you were only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white. it is amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do.   PS - Nice dive on that high stick Mario. Everyone knew it was a high stick, you could have stayed on your feet and saved your diving talent for later.  just stirring it up a bit, Ralph
