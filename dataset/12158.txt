May I suggest getting your mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED?  This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.  (nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about 50 cents a piece, even though I had to buy 100 of them....)  \tBTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts...honest, 6 WATTS.  I do not have the book here at work so I cannot recall the company name.  The 6 watter am not cheap, around $108 but if you want some power, mamamia, that is pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a 1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals. If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the pertinent info.  \tNow, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida. Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like  nice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices, so they might be able to help you out.  \ti am curious about your applications if you do not mind saying. The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you had need to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz......  Duane
