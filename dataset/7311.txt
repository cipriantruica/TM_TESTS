From: mauritz_c@spcvxb.spc.edu Subject: Weird problem with GM 4-banger transmission  i am having an interesting problem with my girlfriend is car.  Before I delve into its innards, I thought i had check  net.wisdom  on the subject. :)  it is a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know) 2.0l EFI 4-banger auto 35k miles  When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of getting  stuck  in 3rd gear.  As a result, when you stop for a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to  reset  and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when put in drive.    My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).  My background is that my father owns a service station and I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Please feel free to be as technical as you want. :)  i had appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free beer.   Skoal,  Chris
