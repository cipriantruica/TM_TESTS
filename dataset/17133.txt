Until Syria leaves, and free elections take place, its is rediculous to claim that the Lebanese would even be involved in determining what happens to their country.  >Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon.

There is little evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities.  \tThey evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take place over the Jordan river, the existance of large, patrolled kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area, where they are usually picked up in the morning.  >|>\tA second reason was political.

According to Arafat, Israel must be destroyed.  He has never come clean and denied that this is his plan.  He always waffles on what he means.  \t``When the Arabs set off their volcano, there will only be Arabs in \tthis part of the world.
