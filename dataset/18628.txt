SOme of the most \t\tnon-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME \t\tif you hit it with the right combo.   \t\tlet us take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke; \t\talready burned right?  cannot go boom, right?  Wrong.  \t\tSuck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized, \t\tor burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air \t\tconditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light \t\ta match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when \t\tfilled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT  \t\t\tTHAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING \t\t\tTILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of \t\t\ta building have blown OUT by  nonflammable _smoke_   \tSo: \t\tTake a little  nonflammable aerosol  \t\tMix with gasoline or kerosene fumes  \t\t\tNO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating \t\t\ton the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink \t\t\tsince the water was cut off?  \t\tliberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours  \t\tFumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians \t\tmove the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one, \t\tarmor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick \t\tand die from tear gas.  \t\tand along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:  \t\t\teveryone burns to death.  Try thinking before opening mouth: it may not have happened the way the Gmen say it did.  > >--  >_/_/_/  Brian Kendig                             Je ne suis fait comme aucun >/_/_/  bskendig@netcom.com                de ceux que j\'ai vus; j\'ose croire >_/_/                            n\'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent. >  /  The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre. > /    is that it ends.                                           -- Rousseau
