WABC did the same thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30, because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of  the reasons for this is left to the reader ...  it is too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team coverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN is coverage of the Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  i have read that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing this job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say about the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz is shills on SC Chicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair, SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.  From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert is voice from the CBC coverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we could not get it on ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.  Mike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne. Mike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.
