But again.......where was Andreychoke in game 1?  I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr, specifically because I thought it would help them win at least one playoff series.  However, I do not think the Leafs can be faulted either...there is nothing to say that Felix will not be winning playoff series by himself in years to come.    Anyway, does anybody else find it ironic that Fuhr is up against Moog? (or at least he was until a guy named Alex showed up....:-) )   --
