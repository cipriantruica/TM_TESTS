They all have had this problem. There was a recall on the T-bird for the brake  problem. The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp  after about 10K miles. Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on  the T-Bird i shall never buy a Ford again.        Bruce S. Winters\t\t\tBSW@utrc.utc.com United Technologies Research Center \tE. Hartford Ct.
