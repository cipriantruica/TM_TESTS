It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  it is overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users. \tSpeaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that is like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that is  just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs,  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM.  Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that is okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August. \tThe Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS is to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so do not scorn the concept.) \tAnyway, do not expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo will not be out  til \'96. \tWith luck, i shall be proven wrong! =)  Rob           |------------------------------------------------------------|                               rmohns@vax.clarku.edu       /                _________                                /________                                     Rob Mohns         /                ==================================================                     Annoy Rush Limbaugh.
