From: infante@acpub.duke.edu (Andrew  Infante) Subject: Insurance and lotsa points...  Well, it looks like i am F*cked for insurance.  I had a DWI in 91 and for the beemer, as a rec. vehicle, it shall cost me almost $1200 bucks to insure/year.  Now what do I do?  (I could probably just sell the bike and return my DoD number,... )  --  Andy Infante  | You can listen to what everybody says, but the fact remains   | \'71 BMW R60/5 | that you have got to get out there and do the thing yourself.   |  DoD       |                             -- Joan Sutherland                |  ==============| My opinions, dammit, have nothing to do with anyone else!!!   |
