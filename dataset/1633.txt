From: UC512052@mizzou1.missouri.edu (David K. Drum) Subject: What has happened to DKB-L@TREARN???  Hello,   i have been on the DKBtrace/PoVray mailing list out of trearn.bitnet for some time now, but when I tried to post the other day the listserv told me that the list does not exist!  So I got a global list of groups from the listserv and - - NOTHING!  I grepped every string I could think of.  If Frank, Ville Saari, Andre Beck, or anyone else who has a regular on DKB-L can tell me what is going on, please do!   Regards,   David K. Drum uc512052@mizzou1.missouri.edu
