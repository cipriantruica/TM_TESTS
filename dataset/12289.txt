From: fmg alpha.smi.med.pitt.edu (Filip Gieszczykiewicz) Subject: Switching PS questions   \tGreetings. i have recently decided to chuck the linear regulators \tand learn the  black magic  art of switching power supplies... \t(before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-)  \tAnyways, i have built the basic up & down converters with pretty \tgood results (>80% efficiency) but i am running into problems \twhen I try to design & build anything that puts out serious \tamps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V 200A guts on my \tbench) but something puzzles me: i am using a simple choke as  \tthe storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding) \tbut ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings. \tI traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for \tthe usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose \tme... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a full \tschematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? i had \tlove to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such \tlow volume :-)  \tMy other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are \t1) Lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2) \tLimited knowledge of the whole topic... i am doing this on my \town (not school) mind you (in fact, I have yet to take any \tcourse that covers transistors ;-)  \tSo, is the answer to   the accumulation of dead commercial \tmodels and truning into a scavanger (not that it is not what \ti am doing now...) and   getting & understanding schematics \tand a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory?   \tTake care.  \tP.S. My goal is 12V   ~25A in (car battery) -> 250VAC out and \t(on the other end) 250V -> +5VDC   5A, -5V   1A, +12VDC  8A \tand -12VDC  1A... the distance between the two will be \tmore than 100 feet (of 14-16 gauge) but less than 300 feet. \tWould like to have a working model in a year or so... :-)  \t(Do I have a chance to make it?) --  / Filip  i shall buy a vowel  Gieszczykiewicz. | Best e-mail  fmgst+ pitt.edu     | All ideas are mine but they can be yours for only $0.99 so respond NOW!!!! |  | I live for my EE major, winsurfing, programming, SCA, and assorted dreams. |   200MB Drive - Linux has 100MB and MS-DOS has 100MB.
