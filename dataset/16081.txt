Our society does not,    >however, condone their possession or use.    Actually, Joe, I wrote the above.  Peter was responding to my article.  i am actually rather confused by your post.  I suppose I did not make myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the opposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose  the authorities  might have been a better term than  society .  Carry and use a firearm in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect, at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do. And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.     In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or    so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-    abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny,     though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a     lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.      IMHO, you do not need to be either a political philosopher or     a crime victim to realize that there is a flaw in the gun-    grabbers\' logic.    Agreed.     you are welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as     important as the Second, but please do not let your obvious     good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities     about something as big and diverse as US society.  My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable weapons of self defense does not mean you shall escape a whole shitload of trouble should you be forced to use them.     Or by the    naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause     to someone who would be a criminal anyway.  I made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.          Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself    if others\' thoughts are not that kindly,  that is all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to  have the means to defend myself when that in not possible.  I *think* we agree on this issue.  I guess my position did not survive the transition from cognition to ASCII.  --  Garry Hodgson\t\t\tA slow winter day AT&T Bell Labs\t\t\tA night like forever garry@alice.att.com\t\tSink like a stone att!alice!garry\t\t\tFloat like a feather
