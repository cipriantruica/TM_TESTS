I just cannot imagin any valid reason for having a gun that cannot wait a few days. I can think of plenty of bad reasons for not wanting a waiting period: I want to buy a gun and kill so-and-so right now, i have crossed the state line to buy a gun illegally and I cannot afford to spend the night here, etc.  i am not a big fan of guns, but I feel that it is important to guard American is rights to own them.
