But that was not, with respect to the children, the point of the gassing. The feds *knew* that the children is health would be in danger and proceeded under the assumption that the  motherly instinct  of the Davidian women would remove them from harm is way. I busted a gut on that one.  Someone else on the net observed that the administration is appeal to a woman is  motherly instinct  would never wash with feminists and liberals if a republican were in the White House. I say that such an justification could *only* come from a feminist mindset.   BTW - i had read in the paper yesterday that the type of gas used was CS2. The paper did not provide any specifics about it.   Guess i am still writing...
