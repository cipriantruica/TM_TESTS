And to be honest >with you, i am beginning to wish that it was never written.  I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way it was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the  yeast connection .  But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In the meantime, i had still encourage people who have  incurable  chronic sinus problems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with liver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It is an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT says  sorry, you shall just have to live with it , it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence (Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At this stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with relatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  i am glad I did this, since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of course, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you.  Talk to your doctor.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.
