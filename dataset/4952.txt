Glad to hear that it is working for you!  I could not find it on  export .  However, Simon Leinen  has added an Imakefile and an Athena version, and made it available for FTP in the file liasun3.epfl.ch:/pub/X/contrib/xrpc.tar.z.  (Note the  .z  suffix; you shall need GNU gzip -- also on liasun3 in /pub/gnu -- to uncompress it.)    If this does not work, send me a note and i had be happy to mail you a copy; but you probably will not get it until the start of May -- i am on holidays as of tomorrow! :-)  --  Martin Janzen  janzen@mprgate.mpr.ca (134.87.131.13) MPR Teltech Ltd.  8999 Nelson Way  Burnaby, BC, CANADA  V5A 4B5   P.S. Are there any Dublin X folks that want to go for a pint of Guinness at, say, Mulligan is...?
