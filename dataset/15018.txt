From: rolfe@junior.dsu.edu (Tim Rolfe) Subject: Divine providence vs. Murphy is Law  Romans 8:28 (RSV)   We know that in everything God works for good with those  who love him, who are called according to his purpose.   Murphy is Law:  If anything can go wrong, it will.  We are all quite familiar with the amplifications and commentary on Murphy is Law.  But how do we harmonize that with Romans 8:28?  For that matter, how appropriate is humor contradicted by Scripture? --                                                     --- Tim Rolfe                                                  rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu                                                  rolfe@junior.dsu.edu
