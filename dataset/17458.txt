From: gal2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Jacob Galley) Subject: Clinton is sister, Shalala   Last night I heard something about Bill Clinton is sister being involved in a marijuana bust, and the news being suppressed. I also heard something about her being an  ex-con . This source is not reliable, though. (It was a collage/booklet advertising a local band.)  Can anyone on the net verify this or provide more details? i am surprised I have not seen anything about this in this newsgroup.  Also, does anyone know what happened to the charges that Shalala was a regular pot smoker when she was in college? This ghastly accusation was reported on CNN Streamline News the day she was nominated, then I never heard anything about it again.  it is almost enough to make me want to start an Act-Up type campaign to invade the privacy of closet smokers! (If only this type of publicity did not violate people is rights. . . .)
