On the other hand, it would be kind of scary if there were *never* a final verdict, because a party to litigation could keep saying  Oops!  I forgot to bring up this evidence,  and demand a new trial.  You get one bite at the apple.  >\tOr has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed?  >should not that be up to a jury?  it is up to General Motors to find those witnesses in the first litigation. you had be up in arms if a plaintiff suing General Motors pulled the same stunt and made them relitigate an issue that they already lost.  it is not as if General Motors could not file enough discovery motions to delay the trial until they found all the witnesses they wanted.  >\tAnd what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk >shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM?    Define  obvious bias.   >should not that be enough for >a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial?  Did GM move for a new trial on those grounds?  No?  Perhaps they had a  reason?   --  ted frank                 |  thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |         i am sorry, the card says  Moops.  the u of c law school     |  standard disclaimers      |
