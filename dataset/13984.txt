This is not really light pollution since it will only be visible shortly before or after dusk (or during the day).  (Of course, if night only lasts 2 hours for you, you are probably going to be inconvienenced. But you are inconvienenced anyway in that case).  Finally: this is not the Bronze Age, and most of us are not Indo European; those people speaking Indo-Eurpoean languages often have much non-indo-european ancestry and cultural background. So: please try to remember that there are more human activities than those practiced by the Warrior Caste, the Farming Caste, and the Priesthood.  And why act distressed that someone is found a way to do research that does not involve socialism?  It certianly does not mean we deserve to die. -- Phil Fraering         | Seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff. pgf@srl02.cacs.usl.edu|Like how the ancient Mayans had televison.
