Incidentally, my MP has responded to my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved\' countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy\' countries will get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the capabilities of the base station.  The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but  cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider is equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can listen without having to obtain a warrant.  But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see above - they do not *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts, but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge, it appears he was not a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we will stop listening in\'...  You have every reason to be scared shitless.  Take a look at the records of McCarthy, Hoover (J. Edgar, not the cleaner - though they both excelled at sucking) and Nixon.  - --Paul  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: 2.2  iQCVAgUBK9IAl2v14aSAK9PNAQEvxgQAoXrviAggvpVRDLWzCHbNQo6yHuNuj8my cvPx2zVkhHjzkfs5lUW6z63rRwejvHxegV79EX4xzsssWVUzbLvyQUkGS08SZ2Eq bLSuij9aFXalv5gJ4jB/hU40qvU6I7gKKrVgtLxEYpkvXFd+tFC4n9HovumvNRUc ve5ZY8988pY= =NOcG -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
