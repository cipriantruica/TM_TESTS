Have you ever heard of the First Amendment?  I guess not.  It is not a crime to be a religous (I know you said  sacraligious , but it is not your place to judge his religion) zealot in this country.  REMEMBER we have freedom of religion in this country! I guess you are selective in that respect!  So what if they were  bastard  children.  They were CHILDREN!  Do you condone their deaths?  I pray for your lack of a soul if you do! --  John B.
