From: icop@csa.bu.edu (Antonio Pera) Subject: ABC coverage   \tI loved the ABC coverage. The production was excellent. The appearance was excellent. It had a sleek modern look. This was the first time I heard Thorne & Clement & I thought they were great. My only request is to leave Al Micheals out of this. He annoys me.  \ti am hoping this leads to a regular-season contract. My guess would be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from Feb.-April and then the  playoffs. I envy you Canadians with your TSN & CBC. Maybe i shall get a dish to pick up Canadian TV. How much are those things, BTW?
