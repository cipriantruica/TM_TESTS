And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow  Yes, everyone who is normal does that.  We use candida on the other arm when we put a tuberculin test on.  If people do not react to candida, we assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not react to anything.  All normal people have antibodies to candida.

Find something that no one can *disprove* and then write a book saying it is the cause of whatever.
