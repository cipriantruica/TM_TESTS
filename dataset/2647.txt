From: cui@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Jun Cui) Subject: How to hold the control to a window object?  //i am using BC++ is ObjectWindows (version 3.1) and trying to get some data  //processed in a window object. However, when the calling program invokes  //the window object, it gives up the control to the window object, and keeps  //executing the next statement. I would like the calling program, after  //invoking the window object, to wait until the window object is closed.  //Can I do that? My program may look like:  class MyWindow : public TWindow { \t... };  void MyCallingProg(...)  // Could the calling program be a C function? {\t... \tMyWindow *MyWinObj; \tMyWinObj = new MyWindow(...); \tGetApplication()->MakeWindow(MyWinObj); \tMyWinObj->Show(SW_SHOWNORMAL);  \tnext statement;  // I want the program to wait here until MyWinObj \t...              // is closed so that I can get some data back from  \t...              // MyWinObj. I specified the window style to be  \t...              // WS_POPUPWINDOW, did not help. Is there any other way  \t...              // to execute the window object so that the calling     ...              // program will not give up the control? Any help would  }                   // be appreciated.   Thanks.  -- Jun To talk to the Lord with PS/2 through MS-Windows
