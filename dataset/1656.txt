AVS is a point and click, module driven, easy-to-use product that produces full color, two or three dimensional rendered scenes for interactive observation.  It is supported on all current Unix RISC platforms from Sun, SGI, IBM, H-P, DG, and DEC.  It also runs under DEC VMS.   AVS is in its fourth year on the street and is very mature.  All fields of science, engineering, medicine, and even business applications now use AVS.  This seminar will focus on its many features in technical detail during a half hour slide presentation.  Following a question period there will be a live demonstration using a Sun SPARCstation.  In addition, a new AVS program called CAMPUS will be introduced at this meeting.   Also discussed will be the International AVS Center, which provides an on-line repository of over 1000 graphics modules at the North Carolina Supercomputer Center in Raliegh, NC.  AVS has imbedded tools to write one is own customized modules should these not be available with AVS or from AVS International.                                _\x08S_\x08p_\x08e_\x08a_\x08k_\x08e_\x08r_\x08s       The scheduled speaker for this presentation is Mr. Paul Ecklund of Ecklund Associates, the distributor of AVS in Canada.            _\x08T_\x08h_\x08i_\x08s _\x08p_\x08r_\x08e_\x08s_\x08e_\x08n_\x08t_\x08a_\x08t_\x08i_\x08o_\x08n _\x08i_\x08s _\x08o_\x08p_\x08e_\x08n _\x08t_\x08o _\x08t_\x08h_\x08e _\x08p_\x08u_\x08b_\x08l_\x08i_\x08c
