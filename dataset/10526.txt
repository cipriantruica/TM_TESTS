On the other hand, i am hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes Fereirra made.  Imagine indeed, but then again we have the benefit of hindsight.  let us say that in the view of the Sharks\' upper management, the attempt to trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra. i am inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept him...he has obviously the luckiest man in hockey!  (Wonder what sacrifice he made to the Muse of Fax?  (His job, I guess.))  have fun gak  --- Richard Stueven       AHA# 22584 |----------| He has erected a multitude of new Internet:            gak@wrs.com |----GO----| offices, and sent hither swarms ATTMAIL: ...!attmail!gakhaus!gak |---SHARX--| of officers to harass our people, Cow Palace:            107/H/3-4 |----------| and eat out their substance.
