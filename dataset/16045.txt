Gritz was well-aware of Duke is presence on the ticket.  Given that Gritz is not at all shy about associating and promoting other white supremacists (such as the Christian Identity movement or Willis Carto), whatever reasons Gritz had to leave the ticket had nothing to do with Duke is presence.  >>So Gritz gave up his >>chance to be Vice President of the US just to aviod supporting >>Duke. > >i had hardly call that  giving up his chance to be Vice President of the US ; >the chance of the Populist Party ticket winning is essentially nil.  Still, >it does imply that he does not want to be associated with Duke.  I believe Chip Berlet has a Populist Party newsletter from the time with a photo of Gritz happily shaking hands with Duke. --  ted frank                 |  thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |         i am sorry, the card says  Moops.  the u of c law school     |  standard disclaimers      |
