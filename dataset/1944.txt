From: kmembry@viamar.UUCP (Kirk Membry) Subject: roman.bmp (NO!)  Please do not post uuencoded bitmaps here.  If you want to do so, put them in the alt.binaries.* areas.  These files are very large and may crash some users newsfeeds.  it is also a waste of band width.  Also, we all know how to convert .gif to .bmp with many programs so it had really not worth posting all of these .bmp files.  - thanks  --  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Kirk Membry                                     Our Age is the Age of Industry  rutgers!viamar!kmembry                         - Alexander Rodchenko -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
