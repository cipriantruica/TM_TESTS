There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I saw, however propane is interesting stuff.  It does not explode on contact with air.  It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to the tank.  Damage from the CEV is could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing the gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere, and maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially semi-rural areas.  > \tFurther, the BD members have as much reason to lie as the  > \tGov\'t.

What about you?    I think it would have disarmed many people if the FBI followed this same policy.  They have not.  They are making claims without evidence, and what evidence we have so far tends to refute their story.  semper fi,  Jammer Jim Miller  Texas A&M University \'89 and \'91 ________________________________________________________________________________  I do not speak for UH, which is too bad, because they could use the help.
