I4s and flat4s are abundant.  >V6 - Legend, MR3? MR6?  A whole $h!tload. Minivans, pickups, just about any car above the subcompact/compact range and below the full-size range (with a few exceptions).  I6s are much more rare now; the only one I personally know of that is still in production is the venerable Ford 300CID in the F-series pickups. I think that Jeep is big 6 is are also straight sixes, but i am not a big Jeep person.  >V8 - do not know of any.  Where are you to not know of V8s? There are Mustangs, Cadillacs, Lincolns, Camaros, Corvettes, Thunderbirds, all real full-size pickups, Crown Vics, Chevy Moby^H^H^H^HCaprice ;-), and even a few Japanese and European vee-hickles with V8s.  V10 - Dodge Viper; Dodge promises a truck with a V10.  >V12 - Jaguar XJS  do not Ferarri and Lamborghini both use V-12s extensively?  \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
