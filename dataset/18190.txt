You do not want homosexuals to impose their moral codes     (such diabolical ideas as equal rights) on you, yet you are willing     to impose your moral codes on them.  Do I detect a double standard?          -garison       What do you mean?  If adults want to get together for sodomy in    private, that is their business.      And that is precisely what they do.  So what is your problem with the queer   population, boyo?  The only difference between us is what we do in   private--who we love.      ----bi    Andrew D. Simchik\t\t\t\t\tSCHNOPIA!  Do it in private, and it will not be a problem.  But the reason that the homosexual activists are so hot on antidiscrimination laws is that they want:  1. To be able to wear that lovely chiffon evening gown to work, and not have people get disgusted;  2. To be able to wear their NAMBLA T-shirt and not worry about getting fired;  3. To be able to have access to young boys, so that they start making the next generation of homosexuals.  If your right to privacy is what makes sodomy laws unconstitutional (a position that I agree with), then keep it private, and there will not be a problem. --  Clayton E.
