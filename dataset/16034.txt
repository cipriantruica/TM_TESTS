It would have at least implied that you had some backbone, perhaps a modicum of willingness to present your views and support them.  I guess we all know better now.  >People dumb enough to give their money and possessions to a guy who says he has >jesus deserve all they get  \tReally?  that is interesting, as I was always of the opinion that people dumb enough to keep a monarchy around and support them with tax funds when said monarchy is merely a figurehead deserve all that they get.  Dunkirk, for example.  What?  That has nothing to do with it? Then enjoy your helping of foot.  >Anyway, he killed a few feds  \tAnd they killed a few people of their own, including one child at last report.  So what?  Being a federal agent is not license to kill. Then there is CNN indicating that the ATF/FBI actually *DID* start the fires which would mean feds killed just under 100 people.  If you are so hot to assign blame, make sure you do not overlook the obvious.  >he has not the goddam hero here  \tMontgomery is not much of a hero here, either.  Amazing how different things look on the other side of the pond, is not it?  Not that what you think makes much of a difference in the USA, though, and for good reason.  When you can vote i shall take your rhetoric a bit more seriously.  Right now, you are merely a waste of trans-atlantic bandwidth.  >he has dead an\' i am happy!!!!!  \tProof positive that ignorance really is bliss.
