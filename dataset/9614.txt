Good question.  it is my impression, not backed by evidence, that general south-of-the-borderness seems to exempt one from the hiring-firing effect I was talking about.    Back in the 20 is there were some attempts to hire black Cuban ballplayers;  they were rejected by the commissioner and others.  >>>And why would more hispanics stick around than blacks?  >>do not know.

Well, what *did* I mean to say?  Aside from some short-lived exceptions such as Japanese internment in WW II, only blacks were affected by laws regarding: slavery, Jim Crow, miscegenation, military service, etc.  If my claim of exclusivity is not 100% airtight, that is, if you can come up with this or that exception, fine -- have a cookie.  But compared to this list, no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth discussing at length.  Roger
