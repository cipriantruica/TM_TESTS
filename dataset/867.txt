Any ideas?  \tHmm. I do not think I can help you with this, but you might take a look at the following:  \t Double-Step Incremental Generation of Lines and Circles , X. Wu and J. G. Rokne, Computer Graphics and Image processing, Vol 37, No. 4, Mar. 1987, pp. 331-334  \t Double-Step Generation of Ellipses , X. Wu and J. G.
