From: jan@camhpp12.mdcbbs.com (Jan Vandenbrande) Subject: xv -root with vue? (was Re: xloadimage -onroot ...)  On a related note, how can I use xv to display colored GIFs on my root display with HP Vue?  All I can do with Vue is display xbm is through their Backdrop Style Manager.  xv does not seem to be able to override whatever Vue puts there.  Thanks, Jan  --  Jan Vandenbrande jan@ug.eds.com\t\t\t(New address) jan@lipari.usc.edu\t\t(school address, forwards) UUCP: {uunet, uupsi}!ug!jan
