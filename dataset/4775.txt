The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window Manager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is. But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work without each other, and if one does not like MWMs outfit for some reason, he switches to another windowmanager. All this does not influence Motif, which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.  You cannot say  A Porsche looks like a VW K\xef\xbf\xbdfer  ONLY because they have the wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete different worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel at the same position as MS-W.  -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                   -  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre\' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+
