From: bates@spica.ucsb.edu (Andrew M. Bates) Subject: Renderman Shaders/Discussion?       Does anyone know of a site where I could ftp some RenderMan shaders? Or of a newsgroup which has discussion or information about RenderMan?  i am new to the RenderMan (Mac) family, and i had like to get as much info I can lay my hands on.  Thanks!
