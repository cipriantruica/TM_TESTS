From: tony@minster.york.ac.uk Subject: Re: Revelations - BABYLON?  Woo! So far, we have had the following interpretations of the figure of the `Whore of Babylon\' in Rev 17 & 18:  a) The United States of America b) MHO dB) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who    corrupt and oppress human society c) Historical Jerusalem d) Historical Rome  Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning? How about * The prophecy reveals God is judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous state oppressing his chosen people (d) * That God is judgement extends _especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that City is special call, it still rejected God is grace at the decisive time (Rev 11:8? - also is not Rev19:24 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem?) * That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome/Babylon (a) and is equally subject to God is judgement * That the Good Book(TM) actually encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual powers warring against mankind through the very society that we have created. (b)  Clever, huh? (<-- Flame here!) No need to argue at all!   I think Mary is view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a deliberate contrast between Rev 17/18 and Rev 21/22 - the mortal Jerusalem chosen by God but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation and the new Jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by God is grace. eg Details like Rev 17:1 `.. who sits on many waters\' cf Rev 22 the single stream in the new Jersualem `the river of life flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.\'  Rex - did not understand your post - what is the relevance of Babylonian mystery religions to all this? Please elaborate your ideas about OT & the Book of Rev? Why do you freak at the idea of a primarily `spiritual\' interpretation of Rev? i had mail, but I cannot get thru: \tunknown or illegal user: REFLEX@FNAL.FNAL.GOV Something you are not telling us?
