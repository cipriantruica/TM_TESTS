From: dmoney@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Dean R Money) Subject: The Braves will come around...  To all the Braves doubters:  do not worry.  The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around. The pitching is solid, and as long the Braves do not have serious injuries to the starting rotation, they will continue to pitch well.  Heck, with the five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an injury to one of the five (I hope this does not happen, though).  The bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice is catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there is too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer.  Right now, the Cleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300!  But I certainly would not their seven for our respective seven (though would not the Braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting over .300?).  The bullpen... well, it IS suspect.  But when the bats come alive, the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern.  So anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season.  i am not saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but i am optim- istic about their season (though it is awful painful to watch them at times right now).  Go Braves!!!  Dean.
