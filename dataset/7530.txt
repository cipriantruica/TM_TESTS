Internet extended the convention for >other countries, but the US retained the old conventions.  The general convention is that if it does not have a country tag on it, it is a US site. That includes: \t.com\tcommercial  \t.edu\teducational  \t.mil\tUS Military sites  \t.gov\tUS Gov\'t non-military sites (eg NASA sites) \t.org\tanyone who is  none of the above  There are sites with such tags that are non-US sites, but they will have the country extension (eg xxxx.edu.au is an extension I saw today). US sites can also use the .us extension, but, as Mr. Smith pointed  out, the Internet was built on the ARPANet backbone, and they default to US sites if there is no country code.  I would suggest that anyone who did not know this (or wants to know more about it on a non-system-administrative level) check out the book _The_Whole_Internet_User is_Guide_and_Catalog_ by Ed Krol. (or is it Catalog and User is Guide? I can never remember, and my copy is my desk at home...). it is a very good not-necessarily-technical guide to the Internet and the various utilities that lurk on it (including USENET). I do not think it is part of the Nutshell series, but it is published by O\'Reilly and Associates.  This should go to one of the news.* newsgroups, but damned if I can figure out which one.... :-)  \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
