From: fist@iscp.bellcore.com (Richard Pierson) Subject: Moving On  Well, it is been fun. This is my last day at Bellcore and It will be a while before I have net access again (taking time off and scheduling Military Schools for the summer on joint operations, and anything else that looks good). I have had a blast reading, responding and commenting on things posted here. My final say is 9mm is are inferior to .45 is errr oh wrong news group. Hopefully i shall be back. I guess  internet withdrawl  starts around 1pm or so and considering I never knew inet existed 2 years ago I am really going to miss it.   OH yea, to the guy who called me this morning about the  Military issue  boots, good luck, I think you will be happy with the tankers boots. --    There are only two types of ships in the NAVY; SUBMARINES                   and TARGETS !!!  \tDoD       Next raise Richard Pierson E06584 vnet: [908] 699-6063 Internet: fist@iscp.bellcore.com,|| UUNET:uunet!bcr!fist      My opinions are my own!!!
