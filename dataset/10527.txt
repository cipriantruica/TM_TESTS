As you can see I hate Mario. > Pat Walker > UNB  You, along with Mario Lemieux, must be from another planet.  The only difference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo. Washington, Abe Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come from the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties, but would not you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team an advantage?  I do not remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this year, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about being hit.  He knows it is part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting them up.)  do not you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so much in his life?
