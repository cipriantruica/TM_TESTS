You do not know much about modern automatic weapons, do you?  Just about ANYBODY with basic manufacturing skill can turn out HIGH QUALITY submachineguns.  A  couple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building  submachineguns in the school shop.  I suggest that you go to the library and find a copy of  Smallarms of the  World .  Your entire premise is based on non-factual assumptions.  --  ===================================================================  you are like a bunch of over-educated, New York jewish ACLU lawyers fighting to eliminate school prayer from the public schools in Arkansas  - Holly Silva
