From: kenyon@xqzmoi.enet.dec.com (Doug Kenyon (Stardog Champion)) Subject: Re: Integra GSR (really about other cars)   it is great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out- accelerate an Integra.  But, you have got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars have a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?  No wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power sliding roofs that are opaque.  A moonroof that can be opened to the air, closed to let just light in, or shaded so that nothing comes in.  you have just got to know what is important :^).  -Doug \'93 Integra GS
