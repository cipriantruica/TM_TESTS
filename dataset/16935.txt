He was a dirty Jew.  And the only good Jew, in some peoples mind, is a dead Jew.  Thats what 40 years of propaganda that fails to discriminate between Jew and Zionist will do.  Thats what 20 years of statements like the ones i have appended will do to someones mind.  They make people sick.  They drag down political discourse to the point where killing your opponent is an honorable way to resolve a dispute.  \tWhat else can come of such demagogery?  Peace?

It makes no difference if they        live in Jaffa or Jericho.  I give you explicit orders to open fire.        Do everything to stop the flow of immigration.\'\' \t--- Yassir Arafat, Al Muharar (Lebanese weekly), April 10, 1990  Yassir Arafat on genocide:  \t``When the Arabs set off their volcano, there will only be Arabs in \tthis part of the world.
