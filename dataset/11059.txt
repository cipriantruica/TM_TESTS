I think, with really large keyspaces like this, you need to alter the strategy discussed for DES.  Attempt decryption of several blocks, and check the disctribution of the contents.  I do not think it is at all feasible to keep 2**80 encryptions of a known plaintext block on *any* amount of tape or CD-ROM.  And certainly not 2**128 such encrypted blocks.  (Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar system into a one bit storage device?)      Actually, a keysearch of this kind should not be much worse than the simpler kind in terms of speed.  it is just that you have to do it over for *every* encrypted message.      Dumb question:  Has anyone ever done any serious research on how many legitimate ASCII-encoded 8-byte blocks there are that could be part of an english sentence?  For attacking DES in ECB mode, it seems like a dictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable....      --John Kelsey
