From: tomacj@opco.enet.dec.com (THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO !!!) Subject: MR2 - noisy engine.   G haday people, \t \tAre there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why my MR2 is engine sounds noisy? The MR2 is engine is noisy at the best of times,  but not even a nice nose - it is one of those very ugly noises.  \tI do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month mark, after an oil change (i have been tracking this very thoroughly for months now) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving, but more so during idling.  \twhat is its problem?  \tAlso.. I do not know if it is just me, but if noticed a little performance drop. It just has not got the acceleration it used to.   \tAny help/tips would be appreciated!!   Worried.
