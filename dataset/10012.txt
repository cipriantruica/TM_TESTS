From: nlu@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Nelson Lu) Subject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 5: Left Wings  Apparently, Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I posted it; to make things worse, I lost my own copy.  I have asked on the Sharks mailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copy back.  If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will re-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.   \tLARRY DEPALMA\t\tSeason:\t3rd Acquired:\t\'91-92, free agent from Minnesota Grade:\t\tI (C-/D+)  No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he was not in San Jose, he was not in Kansas City, and his name has not appeared on the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.   \tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd Acquired:\t\'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round \t\tpick in \'92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade:\t\tA/A-  After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5\' 11 , 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year.   \tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th Acquired:\t\'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade:\t\tI (?)  After a banner \'91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks\' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.   \tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd Acquired:\t\'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade:\t\tI (B)  It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers\' decision to unload Pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although he has not considered a physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, Pederson can do.   \tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th Acquired:\t\'91-92, free agent from Boston Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)  Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season.   \tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st Acquired:\t\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)  I do not understand why the Sharks did not let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the \'91-92 season limited Quintin, the team is leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.   \tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st Acquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade:\t\tI (?)  After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5\' 9 , 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although it is too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City.   \tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st Acquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:\t\tI (?)  Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready.   \tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st Acquired:\t\'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade:\t\tI (B-/C+)  The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks\' bait in the expansion draft.   \tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st Acquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:\t\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I should not give a grade at all)  I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  he has not ready, and needs at least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5\' 11 , 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.  =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!
