I  get rather nasty ones from time to time, mostly in the area of the scrotum and the base of the penis. they are nowhere near as dangerous for me as for many women, but goddamn does it hurt in the summertime! Even in the wintertime, when I sweat I get really uncomfy down there. The best thing I can do to keep it under control is keep my weight down and keep cool down there. Shorts in 60 degree weather, that kind of thing. And of course some occasional sun.   Lost Boy
