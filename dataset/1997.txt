While the 64K limit may not be _necessary_ limitation, they probably fall within the category of \'reasonable\' limitations.  If you find yourself trying to allocate an edit control for more than 64K of text, it is probably time take a good look at your program is design.  >Why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory >handles allowed?  In what way is 8192 a  ismall\' number?  It seems to me that you had hit the wall in many other ways before you had hit the systemwide limit on global handles, unless, of course, you are abusing GlobalAlloc.   And _please_ do not try to tell me that it is impossible to abuse the resources available under other operating systems.  All systems have limits.  The question is whether or not the limits are _reasonable_.  So far, you have not offered a single argument which suggests that Windows\' limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems.   --  Rick Schaut UUCP:...{uunet | uw-beaver}!microsoft!richs  Microsoft does not speak for me, and I do not speak for Microsoft.
