If we cannot measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics are not objective either.  that is what I mean when I say there is no objective physics.  Sure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that is maths.  it is only physics when you relate it to the real world, and if we cannot do that objectively, we are stuck.  (Of course, this displays my blatant bias towards applied science; but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real world situations, based on real world observations.)  >                 (Consider, for instance, that speed-of-light-in- > vacuum is invariant.  This sounds an awful lot like an objective > speed-of-light-in-vacuum.)  it is an axiom that it is invariant.  But if the two of us measure it, we will get different answers.  Yes, we call that experimental error, but it is not really  error  in the conventional sense; in fact, if you do not get any, that is an error :-)  You could argue that the value of c is  objective, to within +/-  .  But i had call that a rather odd usage of the word  objective , and it opens the way for statements like  Murder is objectively wrong for all people, to within 1% of the total population.    mathew
