From: jth@bach.udel.edu (Jay Thomas Hayes) Subject: IBM Hardware Forsale    \tI have the following IBM hardware forsale  \tATI VgaWonderXl24 -  This is a great card, it supports 1024x768 256 colors, 800x600 32k colors, and 640x480 16 million colors.  I found that it also speed up windows considerably.  i am asking $100 o.b.o. for this card.   \tI also have 2 2400 baud modems.  I have Docs for both but I do not have the original boxes.  Both work fine and i had like to get $25 each or $40 for both.  \tPlease e-mail all replies to jth@bach.udel.edu \tThanks, \tJay
