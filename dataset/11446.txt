The answer to your second question lies in the way you phrased the first one:  \'the media is...\'.  The medis is not \'is\'.  The media \'are\'.  \'Media\' means \'more than one medium.\'  There are thousands of publications.  Some say this, some say that.         How can the bulk of the people be informed, when they will not read      informative publications? --  Rahul Dhesi  also:  dhesi@cirrus.com
