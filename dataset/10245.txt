From: mosscropm@woods.ulowell.edu Subject: Bleep! Bruins lose 4-3 in O.T.  Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!  The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T.  I cannot stand it!  Aside from frustrated ravings, I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good  on most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense.  Boston players cannot seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net except for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he has also getting plenty of help. Boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the  series score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the  game.  As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period 2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single game (the outlook for the Bruin is advancement to the second round are quite bleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that, they have an excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres in the  2nd and 3rd periods.  (The scary thing is that i shall be going to grad school in Buffalo next year.    i shall never cheer for the Sabres... You cannot convert me... ^:)   MTM3  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Mosscrop  --  Die hard Bruins fan Dept. of Chemistry UMass-Lowell mosscropm@woods.ulowell.edu
