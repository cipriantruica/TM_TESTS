From: watson@sce.carleton.ca (Stephen Watson) Subject: Re: Koresh Doctrine -- 4 of 4  Question for those of you who seem to be fundamentalists (Stephen Tice, the Cotera, Joe Gaut, et al)(apologies if i have mislabelled any of you, i have only started reading t.r.m since the BD disaster.  But I know the Cotera is a fundy) and are defending Koresh and his beliefs as an example of True Christianity under persecution from the the Big Bad Secular State: what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits? If the reports are accurate, what IYO does this say about the quality of his Christianity?  Or are the allegations just part of the Big Cover-Up?  (I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I would not put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.  On the other hand, if the propane-tank-accident story is correct, I would not put it past the FBI to try to cover its ass by claiming Koresh did it.  I hope your government does a VERY thorough investigation of the whole debacle, and i shall be disappointed if a few heads do not roll.  The authorities seem to have botched the original raid, and in the matter of the fire, are guilty of either serious misjudgement, or reckless endangerment.) -- | Steve Watson a.k.a. watson@sce.carleton.ca === Carleton University, Ontario | |  this->opinion = My.opinion;  assert (this->opinion != CarletonU.opinion);  |  Somebody touched me / Making everything new / Burned through my life / Like a  bolt from the blue / Somebody touched me / I know it was you  - Bruce Cockburn
