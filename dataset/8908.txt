I explained that I know that it is essential for some fans to get scores here, for they cannot get them elsewhere.  I have no problem with what you do, posting scores AFTER the games have been completed.  However, like I said earlier, I do not think it is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games, like some others have come to practice.                                         - Sean
