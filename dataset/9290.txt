If they want to speed the games up in sensible ways, that is fine with me too.  However, what I object to is the assertion by baseball people (Whitey Herzog, Buck Rodgers are who i have heard say this) that games are too long because hitters are taking too many pitches, and that the strike zone needs to be expanded. --  John Franjione Department of Chemical Engineering University of Colorado, Boulder franjion@spot.colorado.edu
