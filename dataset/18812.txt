Dear me. This is taken _so_ out of context that it is hard to know where to start... The quote starts with material from p 78, and ends with material from page 81!  On page 78, there is the bit that says (the parts left out in John King is  quote  are marked by ):   the doubt that has infiltrated the previous, smugly confident certitude of evolutionary biology has inflamed passions .   Eldridge goes on immediately following the butchered quote:  In short, evolutionary biology has entered a phase of creativity that is the hallmark of good, active science.   The material that is on page 81 that is  quoted  by John King has been butchered even more severely:    **There is**[these words not in the original text-prl] lack of agreement even within warring camps  Sometimes it seems as if there are as many variations on each evolutionary theme as there are individual biologists.   Eldridge goes on:  But that is the way it should be; this is how science is supposed to operate.   >Jack  And just a few sentences down:   When they [creationists] misrepresent the exuberant, creative doubt and controversy permeating evolutionary biology these days, they are actively promoting scientific illiteracy.   And that, John E. King, is precisely what you have done with Eldridge is article. Are you personally responsible for the butchery of the text or have you pulled it out of some creationist propaganda? You owe the people reading t.o an apology for posting such misrepresentation.  --  Peter Lamb (prl@csis.dit.csiro.au)
