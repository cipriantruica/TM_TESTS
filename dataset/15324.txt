Marhaba Nabil,  If we posit two minds in Christ, the mind of the logos and the mind of the human Jesus, then we must admit two wills.  A mind is not a mind without a will.  I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements, but there is a philosophical problem here that should examined.  T. V. Morris argued that the Incarnation can be seen like this:        _____________\t\t      (Mind of Logos)      (\t _______   )      (\t(\t)  )\tHere, the mind of Jesus is circumsribed by God the      (\t( Human\t)  )\tSon.  God the Son has complete access to the human      (  ( Mind\t)  )\tmind but the human mind only has access to the mind      (\t(\t)  )\tof God the Son when the Son allows access.  This       (\t(_______)  )\texplains why Jesus said even he did not know the       (_____________)\ttime of the kingdom.\t  The human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free human decision.  But if the human will would have decided differently than what was intended the divine will would have interceded, but this was never the case.  He employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind theory.  The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from the field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing yourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient.    The one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds.  Agreed.  But I am still waiting for Morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two minds making two persons.  Christian analytic philosophers are breaking new ground in explicating the rationality of Theism and the Incarnation.   ====================================           Ted Kalivoda (tedr@athena.cs.uga.edu) University of Georgia, Athens Institute of Higher Ed.   [Note that  person  is being used in a more abstact sense here than the English.  We connect person with personality and other things that are human attributes.  i am not entirely sure whether i had want to apply personality to God, but if it is appropriate, then I think we would have to say that Christ had two personalities.  --clh]
