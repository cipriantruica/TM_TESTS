Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted is drink sometime.  Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in the minors and he has now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (i shall bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I do not have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and did not hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols\' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.  it is not clear he ever learned to hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--  Born 31 July 1962 Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA   1988    195    .282    .320    .328 1990    220    .277    .373    .321 1991    459    .264    .351    .317 1992    485    .249    .359    .290   No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28,  now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it is not a rosy picture.  BTW, i am still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation  coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.
