I would like to see this happen. I do not think it will. I do not think the average gun-owner will take any notice of what is happening until they break down HIS door.  BUT I will go on record publicly to the effect that I will contribute a minimum of $1,000.00 to the buy-out fund if it can be organized and made viable. Anybody else want to put their money where their mouth is?  :) There ar 50+ MILLION gun owners out there. If - and it is a big and not very realistic if - we got hold of CNN, the anti-gun bullshit would STOP RIGHT THERE. Why will not it happen - because nobody will get off their ass and MAKE it happen. Nuts.  Any NRA headquarters weenies listening to this man. Any RTKBA organization honcho listening. it is time to stop fighting the Brady is and the Schumer is (now there is an interesting meaning to the acronynm BS) from the comfort of the office....we had better get serious with our time and money and get after it or we might just as well pack it in now. ---  .
