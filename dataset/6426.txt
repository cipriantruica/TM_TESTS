From: b859zam@utarlg.uta.edu  Subject: INTEL CHMOS 8086/8088 DESIGN KIT  I have this kit which includes the following :  1)\t82c84a/82c84a-5 \tCHMOS CLOCK GENERATOR AND DRIVER \tFOR 8086,80C88 PROCESSORS 2)\t27C64/87C64 \t64K(8Kx8) CHMOS UV ERASABLE PROM 3)\t51C259L \tLOW POWER 64K x 4 \tCHMOS DYNAMIC RAM 4)\t82C59A-2 \tCHMOS PROGRAMMABLE INTERRUPT CONTROLLER 5)\t82C88 \tCHMOS BUS CONTROLLER \tFRO 80C86,80C88 PROCESSORS 6)\t80C88/80C88-2 \t8-BIT CHMOS MICROPROCESSOR 7)\t82C55A \tCHMOS PROGRAMMABLE PERIPHERAL INTERFACE 8)\t82C54 \tCHMOS PROGRAMMABLE INTERVAL TIMER 9)\t82C08 \tCHMOS DYNAMIC RAM CONTROLLER  All these are chips with complete manual in a box. I do not know whether they still work or not, and I do not really know what they are.   So this is mainly for those who knows what this is and have use of it  (probably EE stuff since this used to belong to a EE student)  Anyone interested, please make me an offer.  Jonina
