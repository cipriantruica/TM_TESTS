Having everyone on Earth subject to some ad agency is  poor taste  *is* an abomination. (abomination : n. loathing; odious or degrading habit or act; an object of disgust. (Oxford Concise Dictionary)) Maybe *you* do not mind having every part of your life saturated with commercials, but many of us loathe it. i had rather not have the beauty of the night sky always marred by a giant billboard, and i shall bet the idea is virtually sacrilegious to an astronomer like Sagan.
