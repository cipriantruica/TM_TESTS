From: CM51@lafibm.lafayette.edu (CM51) Subject: Half-page hand scanners?  Is anyone out there using a greyscale handscanner. i am thinking about buying one. Is the inexpensive Logitech pretty good. I do not need super high quality scans- but want it to be worth the $$$$.  Thanks in advance- Mike Charles
