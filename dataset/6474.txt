From: bitzm@columbia.dsu.edu (MICHAEL BITZ) Subject: 1 meg SIMMS for sale ~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~   \tHello.  I have (4) SIMMS for sale.  They are 1 megabyte \teach, and are of the 3-chip variety.  These are very high \tquality SIMMS, and are nearly brand new.  Best of all: \tthey are ***60*** nanoseconds (the fastest available!)  \tPlease make an offer.  I prefer to sell all four SIMMS  \tto the same person (to lessen shipping costs), but if you \tjust want one or two, please make an offer anyway.  \tThanks a lot: bitzm@columbia.dsu.edu   ------------------------------------------------------------ Mike Bitz                   Internet: bitzm@columbia.dsu.edu Research and Development              bitzm@dsuvax.dsu.edu Dakota State University       Bitnet: s93020@sdnet.bitnet
