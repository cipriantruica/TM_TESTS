Please do not talk about Jesus\'  parents --the doctrinal positions \t\tof the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary and \t\tJoseph.  I (personally) have never heard of anything being \t\tattributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood; that is, \t\tno reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven, \t\timmaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only to \t\tMary.  \t2.  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our \t\tdoctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a  \t\tsignificant problem to those who accept the bible as the only \t\tsource of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred  \t\ttraditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is no \t\tproblem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a \t\tunanimous belief among the apostles and all the early  \t\tgeneration that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul, \t\tetc. etc.  It was not until the reformation that these doctrines \t\twere called into question.  As far as I am concerned (again, my \t\tpersonaly feelings) if it is a choice between the apostles or \t\tLuther, i shall choose the apostles every time, whether or not \t\tit is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men \t\thave determined to be  the bible .  \tLike a said, just a couple of notes.  As is often said, I believe that we must agree to (politely) disagree.   \tMay God is peace and blessings be with you always in your search to discover His absolute truth.   \t\t\t- Mike Walker \t\t\t  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu \t\t\t  (Univ. of Illinois)
