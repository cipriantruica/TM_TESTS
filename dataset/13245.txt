From: stark@dwovax.enet.dec.com (Todd I. Stark) Subject: Re: OCD   This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots.  1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used      to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is      misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.     Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug     therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute      it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this     distinction becomes important.  2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions \'impulses\' as a possible  \tdiagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something \tpeople associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or \tunpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.   \tOne of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual \tcan and does suppress some of their \'impulses,\' although they \tare an unending source of anxiety.   \tThe obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with  \tOCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to \ta superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.  \tSome references (one non-technical and several technical) \tthat someone was kind enough to supply for me \tbut was unable to post themself :  | The boy who could not stop washing  by judith rapaport.   ***  \t(technical refs) :  |\tpharmacotherapy of o-c disorder |\tdonna m jermain and lynn crismon |\tpharmacotherapy 1990; 10(3):175-198  |\tepidemiology of ocd |\tseteven a rasmussen and jane eisen |\tj clin psychiatry 1990;51(2, suppl.):10-13  |\tthe waking nightmare: an overview of ocd |\tjudith l rapoport |\tj clin psychiatry 1990; 51(11, suppl.):25-28  |\tabsence of placebo response in ocd |\tmatig r mavissakalian, bruce jones, stephen olson |\tj nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no. 4  \tAnd thanks very much to those who supplied constructive   \tcriticism to my first post on OCD.  I hope this helps clarify \tthe parts that were misleading.  \t\t\t\t\t\tkind regards,  \t\t\t\t\t\ttodd +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Todd I.
