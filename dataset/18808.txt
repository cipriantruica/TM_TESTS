Innocence and the sin nature are two different attributes.  >The baby is innocent, yet the baby is a sinner.    >You have two arms and two legs?  Why?  Because your parents did. >Why? Because their parents did.  Etc.  Did you do anything to get them?  The thing is, I know what arms and legs are.  it is therefore generally easy to tell whether or not someone has arms and legs.  This  sinful nature , since it does not require that the baby actually perform any sins, seems to be totally invisible.  As far as I know, maybe half the babies have a sinful nature and half do not--it had look exactly the same, since there is no way to tell the difference.  >We are born sinners.

We get it because our parents had it, their >parents had it, their grandparents had it, etc, infinitum.  So what is so bad about a sinful nature, then?  I could understand it being bad if it always results in people committing sins, but babies can have it, never commit sins, die, and they still have it.  So the bad part about cannot merely be that it results in people committing sins--so what _is_ bad about it? --  On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...  Leftover Turkey!
