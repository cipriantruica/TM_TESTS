Having driven both, and having owned an SC300 for 14 months now, all I can say is  it depends .  they are both great cars.  In fact, my wife and I are saving our pennies so we can get her the 300ZX convertible in a year. The 300ZX handles like a dream, while the SC300 rides like a dream. Fit and finish on both are excellent, but the Lexus gets the nod in customer satisfaction.  they are both very attractive, and hideously expensive.  The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX.  The 300ZX is not available with traction control, which makes it a handful on slippery surfaces. --  Jim Battan - Sequent Computer Systems, Beaverton, OR battan@sequent.com or uunet!sequent!battan +1 503 578 5129
