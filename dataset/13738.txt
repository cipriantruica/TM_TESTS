From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins) Subject: Re: Russian Operation of US Space Missions.  I know people hate it when someone says somethings like  there was an article  about that somewhere a while ago  but i am going to say it anyway.  I read an article on this subject, almost certainly in Space News, and something like six months ago.  If anyone is really interested in the subject I can probably hunt it down given enough motivation. --  Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu            Tout ce qu\'un homme est capable d\'imaginer, d\'autres hommes             \t     seront capable de le realiser  \t\t\t -Jules Verne
