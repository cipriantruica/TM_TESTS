No crime here. Also no substantiation of your claim that Koresh said this.  I for one have never heard this mentioned before.  Where did you hear it?  > But granted, up to that moment, he had done nothing >wrong. I recognize and respect that.  Up to which moment?  The one where you decided that anyone who claims to be God no longer has the protection of the Constitution? What happened to the separation of church and state?  >Then the ATF discovers he does not have proper permits for some of his >purchases and failed to pay some taxes on them.   I have yet to see any evidence of *this*, either.  From what I hear the *original* warrant (the reason for the Feb. raid) is still sealed.  What are  unsealed  seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid.  >Then several parents come forward and demand that previous charges of child >abuse be refiled. There have been interviews with some parents whose >children were in the compound at some point.  Funny, I have not seen any of these  interviews.  Interesting that when the social services agencies investigated Koresh on these previous charges, they found absolutely no evidence of abuse.  > These parents claimed >psychological and sexual abuse. The childrens\' statements supported these >charges.  Funny, I do not remember hearing anything about childrens\' statements, either.  Where did you say you heard all this?  What *I* heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in the seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse, physical or mental.  This from the newspaper and national TV news.  Did you also hear that it is the job of the BATF and the FBI to lay siege to homes where child abuse is suspected?  I thought you did.  >Was it a \'no-knock?\' I really have not heard anything on that. But clearly >he was not just another guy minding his own business.   Clearly?   Please tell us what Koresh was doing that can be construed as other than  minding his own business  before the BATF raided the place.  > Hell, give them all >the guns in the world if they do not bother anyone. But he was a scary sort, >do not you think? The sort of person you had want your daughter to date? I >did not think so. Reason number one to doubt the legal statements made by >some of the survivors.  Your logic just amazes me.  I think your grandparents who died in Auschwitz would be turning over in their graves if they could hear how cavalierly you throw away people is protection of law because you think they are  scary  and  not the sort of person you had want your daughter to date.   What sort of people do you suppose the Nazis thought your grandparents were?  Probably not the sort they would want their little frauleins dating...  > (Note that some of them were made by his \'guard,\' >well-[hesitate to say expertly] trained killers).  And next I suppose you shall tell us exactly WHO these  well-trained killers  have killed?  >Then he fired on the ATF. that is not just a little mistake, or some >red-white-and blue American defending his home against Big Brother. That >shit does not fly.  Because you said so, right?  Right.  > Anyone with his background that will shoot and kill >Federal Law Enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade >enjoys our support.  So someone with a different background, say someone who did not claim to be the Messiah, in your book COULD shoot and kill Federal Law Enforcement officials WOULD be a good citizen whose crusade enjoys our support?  > he has a loose cannon. Just my opinion...  Worth the paper it is printed on.  you are amazing, simply amazing.    -joe
