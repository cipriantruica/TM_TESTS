From: twillis@ec.ecn.purdue.edu (Thomas E Willis) Subject: PB questions...  well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after starting life as a 512k way back in 1985.  sooo, i am in the market for a new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be...  i am looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch of questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer:  * does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook introductions are expected?  i had heard the 185c was supposed to make an appearence  this summer  but have not heard anymore on it - and since i do not have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had more info...  * has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the ones the duo is just went through recently?  * what is the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing a 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i do not really have a feel for how much  better  the display is (yea, it looks great in the store, but is that all  wow  or is it really that good?).  could i solicit some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize this is a real subjective question, but i have only played around with the machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).  * how well does hellcats perform?  ;)  thanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i shall post a summary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the corner... :( ) -- Tom Willis     twillis@ecn.purdue.edu         Purdue Electrical Engineering ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.   - F.
