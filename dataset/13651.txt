While organics would become significantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thus some things would no longer be economically feasible), oil is hardly an irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables.  As supply decreases, prices rise and alternatives become more competetive.  He also needs to consider that there has been an estimated 30 years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has cared about petroleum; whatever the current usage rate is, we always seem to have about a 30 year reserve that we know about.  [i am not sure that last figure is still true -- we tend not to look as hard when prices are comparatively cheap -- but it was certainly true during hte \'oil crisis\' days of the 70 is.]  --   Insisting on perfect safety is for people who do not have the balls to live  in the real world.    -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I do not speak for others and they do not speak for me.
