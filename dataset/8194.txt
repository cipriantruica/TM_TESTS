If you raise the overall gear ratio too much you shall impair the bike is rideability, because the gears will be far enough apart that there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at any given speed.  Honda 750s do not have the widest of power bands. --      Chuck Karish          karish@mindcraft.com     (415) 323-9000 x117   karish@pangea.stanford.edu
