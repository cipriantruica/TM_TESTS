Do you mean the icons _of_ the program groups, or the icons of the individual programs _in_ the program groups?  I assume you mean the latter, and the answer is: sure you can.  Just click once (not double) on the application icon, then Alt-F P (File | Properties).  Click on the Change Icon box and tell it the icon filename.  Or use the Browse sub-selection.  >(2) Can you set up a short-cut key to return to the Program Manager?  >    I know ,  will do it, but i had rather set it up so I  >    can avoid the task list and get back to the P/M with .

Then release the Alt key.   --  Stan Brown, Oak Road Systems                    brown@Ncoast.ORG English is my native language and I love it.
