I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written specs and documentation.  The case load spec is an example -- the setup section says Apple 14  and 16  monitors can go on top, but 21  and other big ones cannot.  Why could not they publish a maximum load?  Now if I can figure out if there is any hope using the  partition  button on the hard disk setup utility (do I dare just try it and see what happens?), then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more securly.  The  getting more information  section of the manual suggested trying other avenues before calling Apple, but did not mention the net. --  Mike Feldman, Motorola Computer Group,     (217) 384-8538, FAX (217) 384-8550 1101 East University Avenue\t   Pager in IL (800) 302-7738, (217) 351-0009 Urbana, IL 61801-2009 (mcdphx|uiucuxc)!udc!feldman feldman@urbana.mcd.mot.com
