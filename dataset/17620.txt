What, pray tell, does this mean? Just who exactly is *they*? You mean  they  as in people who do not blindly swallow every piece of propoganda they are given? Or  they  as in NOKD (not our kind, dear). Or  they  as in an appeal to some audience that is supposed to implicitly know and understand?  > I really do not want to waste time in > here to do battle about the legalization of drugs.

From a pragmatic standpoint, there certainly is some justification if it is a vice people will commit anyway. Shall we criminalize alcohol again? If the re-legalization for alcohol were done from anything other than the pragmatic standpoint, i had be happy to hear  about it. The fact is that it was not.  > A few more ideas to hold to these criterion - prostitution; the killing of all > funny farm patients, AIDS  victims , elderly, unemployed, prisioners, etc. - > this would surely make my taxes decrease.    Only the first one make any sense. There is nothing to  legalize  about all the rest. Just in case you have not made the connection  (which I expect you have not) the connecting theme in this thread is a persons autonomy over their life and body. Vice statutes serve only to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous for the poor, as Tim so eloquently put it. People will, however, take autonomy over their lives, regardless of what the government says.   And why, pray tell, is AIDS  victim  in snear quotes? Are you of the revisionist sort that thinks there is no such thing as the AIDS plauge? Or do they just deserve it? --   \t\tMichael Thomas\t(mike@gordian.com) \t I do not think Bambi Eyes will get you that flame thrower...    \t\t-- Hobbes to Calvin \t\tUSnail: 20361 Irvine Ave Santa Ana Heights, Ca,\t92707-5637 \t\tPaBell: (714) 850-0205 (714) 850-0533 (fax)
