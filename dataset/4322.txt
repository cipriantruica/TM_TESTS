How can >you boot with it then?  The supplemental manual that comes with the Quadra 800 explains it. I do not have the manual in front of me, but as I recall, you insert the CD while the machine is running, select Restart from the special menu, and then hold down a special sequence of keys to force it to boot from the CD instead of the hard disk. I think the key combination is Command-Option-Delete or Command-Ctrl-Del.
