From: ruhtra@turing.toronto.edu (Arthur Tateishi) Subject: Features for answering machines(esp. digital)   Hello, i am curious what sort of neat features exist on high-end answering machines today. In particular, i am interested in features of digital answering machines. Also, what is the typical amount of storage(in minutes) for these digital answering machines?  The reason? i am hacking together an answering machine program for my ZyXEL modem and i am wondering if i am missing something on my wish list.  arthur --   The first fact to face is that UNIX was not developed with security, in any reliable sense, in mind; this fact alone guarantees a vast number of holes.      --  On the Security of UNIX , Dennis M.
