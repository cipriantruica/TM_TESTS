One difference will _probably_ be the same difference as between OS2 and Windows 3.x now--one will likely have a lot of software available for it and one will not (emulation, with the inevitable incompatibilities that crop up in spite of all the contrary claims, just does not count when you _have_ to use a certain software package that does not quite run properly under the emulation...). Developers want to channel their resources toward a platform that has a large installed base, and in a case like that the platform that is most successfully _marketed_ (regardless of its relative sophistication) will win.
