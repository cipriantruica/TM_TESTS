See Kahn is _The Codebreakers_. >The irony was, they were using better codes and key security than >most governments were.  Yes -- great chapter.  Elizabeth Friedman (sp?) comes shining through.  However, the chapter also notes that these rum runners invented their own crypto -- hired ex-military folks, in fact.  (how has that for a revolving door?)  Now, given that today is rum runners (coke runners, actually) have even more money than yesterday is, it is reasonable to expect them to have even better cryptography.  I doubt they have a chip foundry of their own yet, but ....  So, my question of the FBI/NIST/NSA is:  How are you going to make the rum runners use the Clipper Chip?   Answer:  \tyou are not.  Question:\tOK -- in that case, your justification for taking away our \t\trights has evaporated.  How do you justify our loss of rights \t\tif you cannot use the drug dealers and terrorists?   --   - >  - Carl Ellison                                        cme@sw.stratus.com  - Stratus Computer Inc.
