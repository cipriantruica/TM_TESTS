From: clgs11@vaxa.strath.ac.uk Subject: Jack Morris ??????   Hey guys, who is this Jack Morris fella ??????                      ONLY JOKING !!!!! But try to lighten up will ya ? The season is only just  started and everyone is apoplectic. If all you statheads out there are trying to justify how Morris is doing at the moment, just remember that we are talking about a very small sample size. There is a helluva long way to go, so sit back and enjoy the ride.  Tony.
