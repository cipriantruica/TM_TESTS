From: loki@acca.nmsu.edu (Entropic Destroyer) Subject: Denver Post yanks \'Assault Ads\'   The Denver Post (supposed voice of the supposed Rocky Mountain Empire) ran the following in the \'Firearms, Supplies\' classified heading on  Friday, 23 April 1993.  If you have an opinion about their new found wisdom, I am told that the person to speak with is one Mr. Walters, (303)820-1267.  \tNotice  \tThe Denver Post will no longer  \tknowingly accept any advertise- \tment to buy or sell assault weap- \tons.  The Denver Post finds that  \tthe use of assault weapons poses \ta threat to the health, safety, and \tsecurity of its readers.  Let \'em know what you think...  --Dan -- Spooksmoke: Revolution, Assasination, Thorium, Cobalt-60, Clintin, CIA, NSA, SHC   DoD   / loki@acca.nmsu.edu / liberty or death / taylordf@ucsu.colorado.edu                   Send me something even YOU cannot read... -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: 2.2  mQCNAitfksQAAAEEAKceEjWI9f5KMJyKP0LOgC5dGHRpbMY2xhOo8kpEHMDyuf8a 1BfDQSj53kosTz6HRoshSDzLVuL1/40vPjmMNtFR+vyZ4jvd3rL4iuq2umMmex3M itf3uLt8Xn/v/QAbsvhcFSHVJVK4Lf6wosuCMO03m2TiX31AI7VB0Uzo4yXjAAUX tCREYW5pZWwgRiBUYXlsb3IgPExva2lAYWNjYS5ubXN1LmVkdT4= =S5ib -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
