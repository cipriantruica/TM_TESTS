From: gsh7w@fermi.clas.Virginia.EDU (Greg Hennessy) Subject: Re: New Study Out On Gay Percentage  Clayton Cramer writes:   to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,   Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that   men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general   population.    Did you ever consider the selection effect that those who are willing to admit to being a member sexual minority (homosexuality) are more willing to admit to being a member of another sexual minority (highly promiscious)?   I did not think that you did.  -- -Greg Hennessy, University of Virginia  USPS Mail:     Astronomy Department, Charlottesville, VA 22903-2475 USA  Internet:      gsh7w@virginia.edu    UUCP:\t\t...!uunet!virginia!gsh7w
