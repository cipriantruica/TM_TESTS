It never comes right and says  Only people that know >right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised.   This is not a very sound argument for baptising babies. It assumes that if the Bible does not say specifically that you do not need to do something, then that must mean that you do need to do it. I know there is a specific term for this form of logic, but it escapes me right now. However, if it were sound, then you should be able to apply it this way; If the Bible does not specifically say that something is wrong, then it must be OK, which, coincidentally, leads perfectly into a question i have often pondered. If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyone else in this group does too?), why does not Jesus or any of the apostles speak out against it? Owning slaves was common practice back then. Paul speaks about everything else that is immoral. He apparently thought it was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. Why does not anyone mention slavery? If God is morals are eternal and do not change like the morals of society, then it must have been just as immoral then as it is today.
