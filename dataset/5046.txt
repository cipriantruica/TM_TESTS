From: rank@winf.uni-passau.de (Christian Rank) Subject: Xsun not running on SPARCclassic  i have installed X11R5 with patches for Solaris 2.1 on our SPARCstation LX / SPARCclassic pool. On the LX, X11R5 runs fine, but on the classics, after giving the command startx, Xsun prints the following messages: \tWARNING: cg3_mmap: cannot map dummy space! \tMapping cg3c: No such device or address and exits.  Does anybody know how to fix this problem?  Thanks in advance.  --- Christian Rank Lehrstuhl fuer Wirtschaftsinformatik * Universitaet Passau * Innstr. 29 * D-8390 Passau
