From: menchett@dws012.unr.edu (Peter J Menchetti) Subject: Re: Why does Illustrator AutoTrace so poorly?   I use Arts & Letters on a PC and if you make use of the Tracing Preferences it traces beautifully. BUT - there is a trick to tracing. i have traced entire cartoon images into custom clip art, but you cannot expect to just point to the image and get it just like that, it takes a little work (in some cases a lot of work). You need to trace a drawing piece by piece, and then put it  together... it is kinda hard to explain in type, but if you are ever in Reno I can give you a little demonstration!
