North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he could not get so many  breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne is speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen.  I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars are not as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the class of his own).   Tommi
