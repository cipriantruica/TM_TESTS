Mario   fan, or not you have to respect what he can do with a blade. as for the   hart trophy, i guess winning the scoring title after being out twenty-four   days with CANCER, then leading his team to the presidents trophy and   breaking the win streak record in the process should not even qualify him   for the award. maybe next year he shall tend a few games when barrasso needs   a rest. be realistic, mario has earned every one of his accolades and   deserves all the attention that he gets. lose the jealous attitude and you   may start enjoying hockey at its finest \t\t\t\t-maze
