IMO, the Royals do not have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae suddenly began channeling for John McGraw.  OK, they have some decent pitchers.  But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind and McReynolds and McRae and an over-the-hill Brett, you are not going to finish .500 unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him.  i had say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck.
