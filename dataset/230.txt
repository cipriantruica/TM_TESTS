From: bdunn@cco.caltech.edu (Brendan Dunn) Subject: Re: Amusing atheists and agnostics  Thanks to whoever posted this wonderful parody of people who post without  reading the FAQ!  I was laughing for a good 5 minutes.  Were there any  parts of the FAQ that were not mentioned?  I think there might have been one or two...
