The result is that if my cursor is | over the dialogShell I get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the | applicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the | default colormap.  But i had like it so that if my cursor is over _any_ | window of my application, I get my colormap.  I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm will not allow keyboard focus onto your main shell, and so it will not allow cmap focus either.  Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap focus will not slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.  (if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on MB1). --  David Brooks\t\t\t\t\tdbrooks@osf.org Open Software Foundation\t\t\tuunet!osf.org!dbrooks Showres soote my foote
