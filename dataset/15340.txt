For example, I might decide before going to sleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a specific place.  Or if I am having an unpleasant dream, I can often (not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.  I guess I think that the same standards apply in these  directed  dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref Jesus teaching about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing adultary).  When my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose to dream about, I take that as a sign that all is not well with my  inner life  - maybe I have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin.  In either case, the cause needs to be resolved.    In fact, either case is pretty rare.  I do not often remember dreams that I do not chose to have.  When I do, they almost always tell me something important. I also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour (in fact i have had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can remember, and it was definately spiritually important) I tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and white.  Interesting topic - i shall be fascinated to read other responses.  Alison  PS. Just to make it clear, I do not do ( and have never tried ) OOBEs.     I tend to think they are off limits for Christians.
