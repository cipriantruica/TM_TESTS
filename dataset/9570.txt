All were with Washington. Carlton spent too long in St. Louis to collect less than 700 there.  >With the Rangers, Hough was there for a long time.  \ti had also guess Hough due to his length of tenure though I suspect  Bobby Witt was not far behind.  Maybe even Jenkins snuck in close....  >In the 100 saves department...Maybe Lee Smith(he should have at least >a hundred with the Cubbies, maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards.) >Then maybe, Gossage?(NYY and SD), Fingers (MIL, OAK)  \tFingers had to have achieved 100 with either MIL or with SD so, yes, i had go with that guess.  Otherwise I was thinking that Reardon has a better chance of having 100 with MIN along with (I would think) easily reaching 100  with MON.  >do not know about the homers/steals dept.  \tGotta be Willie Mays...I am fairly sure he had over 300 steals in his career.  >In some other article,(Mets trivia), it could be Tim Leary in at least >the losing to all teams, maybe beating all of \'em too.  Probably Seaver >and Koosman fit too.  \tHmmm...Leary is a really good point.  i had forgotten about him.  Well, if nothing else, there are plenty of ex-Met pitchers in the category of  could have lost to all teams  -- Koosman, Leary, Torrez, Ryan, Seaver.... I guess the best three guesses would be Leary, Ryan, and either Seaver or Koosman.   --  ============================================================================   Thomas Talavage : Purdue University, Electrical Engineering Grad Student  Grad School -- the greatest time of one is life -- where they pay you to do  \twhat you have spent the last 16 years becoming good at!
