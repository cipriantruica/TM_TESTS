From: meyers@uenics.evansville.edu (Christopher H. Meyers) Subject: Internet servers for university[D    Our university is wanting to buy a couple of servers to provide Email to students (@ 2300) and faculty (@ 250). Two servers are being lokked at for one to provide news service and one mail service from a proposed Internet connection. Are there any foreseable problems with this proposed set up? Provided that IHETs is providing an Ethernet line from a Cisco router into our network.  2 X \t486 DX 50 MHz \tSMC Elite 32 or 32TP EISA  NIC \tDual Duplexed 2.5Gb SCSI-2       \twith 5yr parts and labor on everything but the hard drives \trunning UNIVEL UNIX for Application Servers  We will run CC:Mail on a campus wide Novell network to access these . Is there any other aspect I should be looking at?    Which NIC do I use?  Is this enough disk space? etc...    Any help would be greatly appreciated.   --  Christopher H.
