The former primarily targets enemy soldiers.  The latter primarily targets civilians, and not necessarily enemy civilans, at that.  >These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British >soldiers,   Innocent British soldiers?  Like innocent Iraqi soldiers? THe British were EXECUTING Jewish fighters in what was soon to become the recognized Jewish homeland.  The British - to their eternal shame and damnation - were sending shiploads of Jewish refugees, civilians, back to Europe to be taken care of by Hitler.  By comparison, Palestinean  fighters  primarily target tourists, schoolchildren, babies, worshippers, shoppers, movie-goers and other such threatening people.  Early Zionist fighters did no such things.  Your comparison is ignorant and odious.  >\tI mention this not because i am anti semitic [i am part >Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the >Israelites pisses me off so.    Does it bug you that the  Israelites  (they used to be Israelophiles...) happen to be right?  >i am not as critical of the >Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the >Jews.    Are you kidding?  Palestinean Arabs - who comprise a tiny proportion  of the world is refugee population, who have almost no justifiable claim to the territory that they desire, who have acted as criminals in the international community for decades - are being treated like the most aggrieved and deserving minority in existence, even after their ignominious support for Saddam in Desert Storm.  How many other world  leaders  have addressed the UN with a machine-gun in hand, receiving a standing ovation?  >It  is a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for >German and European anti semitism.
