Who gets to decide if >I am a threat?    \tWhen I might possibly be on the receiving end of a violent gesture,  \tthen *I* get to decide for myself.  If someone does not like it, too \tbad.  I would be doing exactly what YOU  or any other living creature \twould do in terms of evaluation.  what is the big deal?  >Based on appearance?    \tSometimes.  >Would someone feel more threatened when approached by a very dirty, smelly,  >slightly-maniacal looking person with a slight glaze to the eyes, muttering  >to himself?    \tI might.  >does not this describe most backpackers after they have been out more than a  >couple of days?    \tNot in my experience.  And let us not forget that context is often an \timportant factor in evaluating a situation.  Seeing disheveled persons \ton a hiking trail is not likely to be evaluated equally with meeting \ta grimey sort, as described above, on a lonely city street at 3 am. \tAnyone that cannot properly discriminate between these two different \tsituations is legitimate fodder for the old  survival of the fittest   \tprinciple.  >Or based on something else?  Proximity?  No room to pass on the trail >without getting *real close* to someone.  An inner sense?  Now i am really  >getting nervous.  \tSounds like you doubt your own abilities.  You sound pretty \ttypical in this respect.  You also seem to think that you shall \tbe safe or safer if others are unarmed.  This is dangerous  \tfantasy.  >Twice when I was hiking the A.T.

Softly I backed >away, and hiked another 5 miles to get *out of there*.  i shall freely admit it here: >i am not afraid of guns; i am afraid of people that bring them into the backcountry.  \tThen you are in need of some form of therapy.  Not necessarily that \tof an analyst, but maybe you should learn about guns.  Your fear is \tseems to be based in ignorance and false knowledge.  You see a person \twith a gun and you feel threatened.  Why is this so?  Have you any \tlegitimate basis for this?  Any first-hand experience that lends \tvalidity to your fears?  Or are your fears based on mediated experience, \ti.e. the anecdotes of others such as network news?  I trust you can \tsee the lack of legitimacy in such mediated inputs?  \tAnd why are you afraid of the PEOPLE as mentioned above?  Forgive me, \tbut you sound afraid to the point of paranoia.  Perhaps you should talk \tto someone about this.  I am not saying this to be rude or fascetious, \tbut I think anyone with fear as deep and baseless as yours *seems* to \tbe needs some sort of help.  Living in fear really sucks, even if it \tis only when around people with guns in the back country.  \tTell me: would you be as fearful of a park ranger who was right in  \tfront of you with their side arm in clear view?  Why or why not?  \t-Andy V.
