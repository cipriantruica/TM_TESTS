From: jhawk@panix.com (John Hawkinson) Subject: Building a UV flashlight  Yes, I know it sounds crazy. Call it an urge. Call it what you want. Just do not ask why :-)  Anyway, i had like to build a UV flashlight, cheaply.  flashlight  means it should be reasonably portable, but could have a power pack if necessary.  My main question is the bulb: where can I get UV bulbs? Do they need a lot of power? etc., etc.  i am not too concerned with whether it is long-wave or short-wave (but hey, if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs, i shall take both).  One other thing: a friend of mine mentioned something about near-UV light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light. Does anyone know what he was referring to?  Thanks much.   -- John Hawkinson jhawk@panix.com
