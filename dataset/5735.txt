From: jlange%radian@natinst.com (John Lange) Subject: WANTED: Used audio mixer   i am looking for a used/inexpensive audio mixer.  I need at least  4 channels of stereo input and 1 channel of stereo output, but I would prefer 8 or more input channels.  Each channel needs to have at least a  volume control.  i shall consider buying broken equipment.  The mixer needs  to be fairly small (I have not got a lot of space for it).
