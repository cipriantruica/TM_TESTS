From:  Douglas Johnson   Subject: Unix crypt for DOS  i have recently moved from Unix to a DOS box and have a number of files  that I used crypt to  protect .  Does anyone know of a DOS version of  crypt?  i have found one, but it insists on six letter keys and I used  some shorter ones.  Thanks for your help.  -- Doug
