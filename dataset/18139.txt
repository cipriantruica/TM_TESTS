I wonder where you have been getting your mis-information from. Straight from the BATF itself?  Koresh and his followers did not -capture- the compound a few years ago, it has always been theirs. A few years ago their was an argument over who should lead the group, a gunfight erupted *one* person died. Koresh was charged with the murder. When the sheriff came to arrest him, the sheriff knocked on the dorr and showed Koresh the warrant (a tactic that the BATF might try learning). Koresh and the others charged peacibly surrendered to the sherrif. A trial ensued, the others were found innocent, and the jury hung on Koresh is charge. --  Mob rule is not any prettier merely because the mob calls itself a government It am not charity if you are using someone else is money.
