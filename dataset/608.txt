But it is STILL HAPPENING.  that is the entire point.  Only last month, John Major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.  The same month, we sold jet fighters to the same Indonesian government that is busy killing the East Timorese.  it is all very well to say  Oops, we made a boo-boo, better clean up the mistake , but the US and UK *keep* making the *same* mistake.  They do it so often that I cannot believe it is not deliberate.  This suspicion is reinforced by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit economy reliant on arms sales.  >                            So it is really not the Gulf War you abhor > so much, it was the U.S. is and the West is shortsightedness in selling > arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable, right?  No, I thought both were terrible.   mathew
