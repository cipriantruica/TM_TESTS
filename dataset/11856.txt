From: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com (Dave Medin) Subject: Emulator pods  A surplus-dealing buddy of mine came up with two emulator pods:  \tHP64220C (for HP 64100 development station). 8086 target \tprocessor. DIP head. Does not include board that plugs into \tthe 64100.  \tApplied Microsystems 80C186/188 pod, LCC head.  If you have an interest in either, let me know. They look to be in excellent condition. He does not know what to do with them, which may mean that they will be cheap.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.
