My gut feeling is that, as a >mechanically resonating device, extreme cold is likely to affect the >compliance (?terminology?) of the quartz, and hence its resonant frequency.  \tLow power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE have significant temperature drifts, which one does not often notice while wearing the watch on one is wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more battery power.    \tProgrammable timers might be less accurate, but they are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.  \tJohn Whitmore
