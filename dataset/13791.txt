It was more than a theoretical concept; it was seriously pursued by Freeman Dyson et al many years ago. I do not know how well-known this is, but a high explosive Orion prototype flew (in the atmosphere) in San Diego back in 1957 or 1958. I was working at General Atomic at the time, but I did not learn about the experiment until almost thirty years later, when  Ted Taylor visited us and revealed that it had been done. I feel sure that someone must have film of that experiment, and i had really like to see it. Has anyone out there seen it?  Leigh
