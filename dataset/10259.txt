What are you complaining about?  I seem to recall last year everyone complaining about SC coverage.  I even remember Orioles\' games being shown in the DC area instead of hockey.  And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other games because its feature game was over?  Sound familiar?  This year i am getting twice the coverage.  I can see all the Caps games *plus* the games ESPN shows.  I think it is great that hockey is back on ESPN.  IMHO, they are doing a great job especially considering the baseball contract they have to work around.  --  Peter Kester pkester@mitre.org
