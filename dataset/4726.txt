It is available on export in contrib/xgks-widget.tar.Z.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  85)  Where can I get an X-based PEX package?  \tThe first official release of PEX is with X11R5; fix-22 brings the Sample Implementation server to version 5.1.  \tThe final PEX 5.1 Protocol specification is now available via anonymous ftp to export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), in the directory /pub/DOCS/PEX/.  Changes made from the Public Review draft are listed in the file  5.1P_changes  in that directory. [9/92]  \tThe final PEXlib 5.1 document is on export in pub/DOCS/PEXlib. [11/92]  \tThere is now available from the University of Illinois an  implementation of the PEX 4.0 specification called UIPEX. It contains a  near- complete  implementation of PHiGS and PHiGS PLUS. The file  pub/uipex/uipex.tar.Z is on a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1); the porting platform was an RT running 4.3.  Questions and comments can to go uipex@cs.uiuc.edu.   \tIn addition, the PEXt toolkit by Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com) is  available on export as PEXt.tar.Z; it includes a PEX widget making it easier to include PEX in Xt-based programs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  86)  Where can I get an X-based TeX or DVI previewer?  \tThe xtex previewer for TeX files is available from a number of archive  sites, including uunet; the current version is usually on ftp.cs.colorado.edu (128.138.204.31) in SeeTeX-2.18.5.tar.Z; pre-converted fonts are also on that  machine. The distribution all includes  mftobdf  which converts PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format, where they can then be compiled for use by your local X server.  \tThe xdvi dvi-previewer is fairly comprehensive and easy to use. It is  also available from a number of sites, including uunet and export.lcs.mit.edu; current version is patchlevel 16 [12/92].  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  87)  Where can I get an X-based troff previewer?  \tX11R4 has two previewers for device-independent troff: the supported  client xditview, and the contributed-but-well-maintained xtroff. An earlier  version of xtroff also appeared on the R3 contributed source. xditview is also in the R5 distribution. \tIn addition, the xman client can be used to preview troff documents which use the -man macros (i.e. man pages). \tIf psroff is used its output can be viewed with a PostScript previewer.  In addition:  \txproof, an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin  Solomon (solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on export in  contrib/xproof*. \t[8/90]  \tElan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff, a modified  troff implementation, and Elan/Express, an X11 eroff previewer.  \tSoftQuad (416-963-8337; USA only 800-387-2777, mail@sq.uu.net or mail@sq.com) offers SoftQuad Publishing Software, including a substantially- rewritten troff formatter, a better intermediate language with backwards  compatibility, and an X11[R3,R4] previewer. (This is the package adopted by  AT&T is own MIS department, and used in and re-sold by many parts of AT&T).  [information from Ian Darwin, SoftQuad (ian@sq.com) 3/90]  \tImage Network (1-800-TOXROFF; CA: 415-967-0542) offers the Xroff  package, which includes a fine modified troff implementation and a set of  X11-based page previewers. (This is the package OEM\'ed by several hardware  vendors.)

Where can I get a WYSIWYG interface builder?  \tA new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works  with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:   This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user   interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates    Wc - Widget Creation  resource files and this distribution also includes the   Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and   Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  \tThe InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder  called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete  with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps  on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175). \tQuest Windows is (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool.   \tDruid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC  machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but  apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for  which it generates C/UIL code.

In addition, the GRAMMI builder supports the development of Ada/X  applications using its own set of objects which are planned to have a Motif  look.  GRAMMI is written in Ada and generates Ada specs and stub bodies.  (1-800-GRAMMI-1).  \tIn addition, these non-WYSIWYG but related products may help for goals  of rapid prototyping of the application interface:  \tWCL: the Widget Creation Library. Basically describes the widget hierarchy and actions in a resources file; available from fine archive servers everywhere, including devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.1.143) in pub/. Wcl provides a very thin layer over Xt without any internal tweaking. Version 2.5 is current [3/93]. \tWINTERP: an Xlisp-based Motif toolkit allows for interpretive  programming. The copy on the R4 tape is outdated; get a copy off export or  email to winterp-source%hplnpm@hplabs.hp.com.  \tThe Serpent UIMS permits the building of user-interfaces without  specific knowledge of coding but with an understanding of attributes being set on a particular [Motif] widget.  Beta Release 1.2 is available from  ftp.sei.cmu.edu (128.237.1.13) and can be found in /pub/serpent.  Serpent is  also available on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.11) in /contrib/serpent.

However, the best source of general information on  building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes.

The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07  may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  95)  Why does not my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym, etc.?  \tIf you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with  libdl.a.  Add  -ldl  to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to  surround it with  -Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic  if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES variable, since  syslibs  get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual  compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.

The patch is on export in [1/93] \tcontrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  97)  Why cannot gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC? I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation faults when running X.  \tNote first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms.  \tHere is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when  gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or  return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and  the server.  \tThis is from the GCC manual:  \tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for  \tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument \tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by  \treference.  \tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet \tsupported in GNU CC, so it is not straightforward to fix it.  \tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and \t`-fpcc-struct-return\' does not help.  You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags.    \tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include: \t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c  \t\trgb/rgb.c  \tIn addition, several of the  inet_  functions use structs as args or return values:   \t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c  \t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c.  Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly  harmless as they do not involve structs.

When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error  \t Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket.  \tFatal server bug! no screens found.   \tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently did not work. You can do  this simple test:  \t   \tSIOCGIFCONF  Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of  interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace).  If the gcc version has \'x\' where the cc version has \'i\', your  fixincludes run did not work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are  identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found  missing  defines for  CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?  \tThe R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:           CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)           CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN           CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN           CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN  \tHowever, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so  references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the  Imakefile.

All of the executables that I try to run have the following results: \tld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even: \tld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c  \tIf you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you  need to run  ldconfig  as root after installing the shared libraries (if you have installed X on a file-server, run it on the server is clients, too).  While  building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those  distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.   If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or  /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked  statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium] \tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)  This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in  X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0 is libXt is based).  It was not documented and was  removed in X11R5 (MIT is guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).    A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site. \t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic). \t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries.  [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]  The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks.  Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?  \tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console  display. Check the man page for fbtab(5).

Although it is not  specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable. \tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not  obvious. \tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and R5 versions are different.  \tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources: \t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X \t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information \t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes\' R3/R4 guide to imake. \t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake \t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful  explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and  config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby.  [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of  send imake-stuff help  to almanac@primate.wisc.edu. \t- see  System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?  by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert. \t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article  Das Meta-Make  / I make, you make / Schwerelos  by Rainer Klute in  iX  Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin , directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal, issue 2:1. \t- The O\'Reilly X Resource issue   contains Paul Davey is article on demystifying Imake. \t- Alain Brossard is working document full of tips on Imake is in  sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.  [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?  \tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier  version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such  configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the  templates distributed with X11R5. \texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution. \tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?  \tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run  xmkmf . This is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a  Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make,  which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why cannot I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error: \tUndefined: \t_XShapeQueryExtension \t_XShapeCombineMask  \tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many  vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway.  \tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library  libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do  not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X  libraries.  [from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with  _XtInherit not found  on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the  error  ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit .  \tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to  get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you cannot share a function that  is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting  _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where  XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called.  \tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere.  \t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a  connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif is 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your  program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in. \t2) alternatively, your program does not need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView  program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.   \tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem. \t [from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be);  11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 111)  Why cannot I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X? I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under  the current version of X, I get this message: \tUndefined: \t_XtScrollBarSetThumb \t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint \t_XtTextReplace  \tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into ); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why does not my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?  \tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called  hints  for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the following:          XWMHints wmhints;         ...         wmhints.flags = InputHint;         wmhints.input = True;         XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)  If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput  resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you do not have source, you can start up the application with the resource \'*input:True\'.  Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having  this done.   \tIf you are using Sun is OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that are not ICCCM-compliant. \tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true  [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?  \tYou cannot reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case.  \tFor most cases, you should not care which window manager is running, so  long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm is push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window  manager is functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available? \t \tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the  Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to  test just  this one little thing  include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4  distributions, and the Xlib  Hello World  example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and  R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4  Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x   by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]  \tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?  \tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this: \t{ \tArg args[3]; \tint i; \tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */ \ti=0; \tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++; \tXtGetValues(widget, args, i ); \t... \t}  But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;  declaring the variable  sensitive  as Boolean works properly. This problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types  Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget is man page. [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why do not XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?  \tyou are probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising  functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use  only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent. \tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions\' being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the  widgets\' data becoming corrupted. \t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be  avoided; they should not be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why is not there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?  \tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the  new  widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget is children? And by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget.  \tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.
