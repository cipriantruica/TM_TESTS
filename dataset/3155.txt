From: ibh@dde.dk (Ib Hojme) Subject: SCSI on dos  Hello netters,  \tI have a question concerning SCSI on DOS.  \tI have a ST01 SCSI controller and two hard-disks conected \t(id is 0 and 1). i had like to connect a SCSI streamer, but I \tdo not have software to access it. Does such a beast exist \tas shareware or PD ? \t \tAlso what if I want a third disk ? I know that DOs only can \t see  two two physical and four logical disks. Will it be \tpossible to use extra disks ?  \tThanks in advance.  \tIb  |               | Ib Hojme |    |   |      | Euromax |  __| __| __   | Dansk Data Elektronik A/S, Vejle branch, Denmark | /  |/  |/__>  | Telephone: Int +45 75 72 26 00 |  __/ __/ __   | Fax:       Int +45 75 72 27 76 |               | E-mail:    ibh@dde.dk
