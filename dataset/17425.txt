Yes, very serious.  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that Rudman says he does not believe Perot was investigating him.  You claim Perot was investigating him.  If you will state that you were in error on this point, provided I produce the source, i shall go dig it up.  Now give me one reason why I should go to the trouble if you will not agree to this?  It is simple enough you know.  But I do not have time to waste if you shall just blow it off with more of the tripe you usually post.    --- Michael Pye email: mpye@csupomona.edu
