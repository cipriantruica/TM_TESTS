From: ski@wpi.WPI.EDU (Joseph Mich Krzeszewski) Subject: Re: Need to find out number to a phone line  Well, this is my second try at posting on this subject. Here goes... \tIn Texas (Corpus Christi at least) if you pick up the phone and dial \t890 the phone company will read the number of the phone you are on  \tback to you. I believe the service department uses this to make \tcertain they are repairing the correct lines when they open the BIG \tjunction boxes. I do not know if it will work but you can give it a \ttry. Good luck.
