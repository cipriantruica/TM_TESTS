Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent toner, like HP is  Microfine  stuff) do not.  Both produce very good output, but you do not have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet output is definitely superior.    On the other hand, LaserJets which have not been maintained properly and use the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much worse than a bubblejet. :-)  One other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets. There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output (such as HP is dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really good looking output (such as HP is DeskJets).  IBM and Canon both produce some of the really good style bubblejets.  \t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad  P.S. -- If you are in the market for a portable bublejet printer, I can highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet, although i have heard the portable Canons are good too (I needed PCL support, myself).  With the DeskJet Portable, you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot!
