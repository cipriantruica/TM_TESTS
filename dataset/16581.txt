Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide is cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha is nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours\'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

In his speech given at the Sivas Congress, Mustafa Kemal once again drew  a picture of the  country under occupation:   In the East, the Armenians are making preparations for advancing to the  River Halys (Kizilirmak), and have already started a policy of massacring  the Moslem population.    pp. 966-967.   The situation of the southern provinces of Turkey after the signing of the  Mudros Armistice is described by Ataturk in his speech:   The Armenians in the south, armed by foreign troops and encouraged by the  protection they enjoyed, molested the Mohammedans of their district. They   pursued a relentless policy of murder and extinction everywhere. This was   responsible for the tragic incident at Maras....the Armenians had completely   destroyed an old Mohammedan town like Maras by their artillery and   machine-gun fire.   They killed thousands of innocent and defenceless women and children. The  Armenians were the instigators of the atrocities, which were unique in  history.
