If you do not watch TV, you are free of commercials there, but if you want to go from A to B you cannot escape beer ads.  >us loathe it. i had rather not have the beauty of the night sky always marred >by a giant billboard, and i shall bet the idea is virtually sacrilegious >to an astronomer like Sagan.  I think the right time to stop this proposal is now.  If this idea goes through, it is the thin end of the wedge.  Soon companies will be doing larger, and more permanant, billboards in the sky.  I would not want a world a few decades from now when the sky looks like Las Vegas.  That would _really_ make me sad.  Coca Cola company will want to paint the moon red and white.  (Well, if not this moon, then a moon of Jupiter).  Microscum will want to name a galaxy `Microscum Galaxy\'.  Where do we draw the line? Historically mankind is not very good at drawing fine lines.  i am normally extremely enthusiastic about all forms of resource allocation for space research; I think it is the most important investment possible for mankind in the long run.  But this is not the way to get the money.          -ans. --  Ajay Shah, (213)749-8133, ajayshah@rcf.usc.edu
