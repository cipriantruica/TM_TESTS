Something having to do with the modem using the main CPU for some of its tasks, and Apple not releasing details on the architecture, or something.  i am vague on the details, but the gist was that there are going to be no third-party internal Duo modems.  If i am wrong, somebody please correct me on this.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
