From: anigbogu@poinsignon.loria.fr (Julian Anigbogu) Subject: X11R5 on Solbourne  Hi Netters, \tHaving inherited a Solbourne (S-4000 : Sun 4 Compatible), I was wondering if somebody has ported X11R5 to this beast. Since Solbournce Computer Inc. folded up I do not know where I can get the kernel to move from R4. Since they never joined the MIT Consortium, the regular distribution does not work. Any pointers will be highly appreciated.  Julian --     ______                   /     /)            __/_    // o __  __   (_/ (_(_(/_(_(_<_/ <         \t\t\tJulian.Anigbogu@loria.loria.fr
