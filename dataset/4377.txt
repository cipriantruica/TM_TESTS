It comes in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap.  At Radio Shack, it is catalog number 276-1372.  it is a mix of silicone and zinc oxide, and conducts heat very well.  Plus, it is tacky.  Usually, you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink, and then bolt or clamp the sink down, but if you do not move your Mac, gravity and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold things in place.  Just make sure you remember it is in there, in case you tilt your Mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose.  You would not want a loose piece of metal running around inside your Mac.
