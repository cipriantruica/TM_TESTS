More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals    showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I   know they have given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff is a   and some local governments. The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can   tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make   AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO is LIDAR units. Most   drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but    this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. it is called   extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost   universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an   increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it does not make you   a riskier driver to insure. Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!  Unless you have some driving history problems, you are usually better to go with one of the major companies and stay there. you shall get long term customer discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as commission. that is another story for another day.
