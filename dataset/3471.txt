Hello, a friend a mine has a commodore 386sx and we have put in that machine a second harddisk, he now has 100+200 MB. But the problem is that the 200MB harddisk is not supported in the bios. Alas there is no user type 47 in the setup. At the moment we use it as a 193MB type but there are getting bad blocks on the harddisk :-<. Question: who knows a solution to this? i have seen a small program for this once in the BYTE, but I have not been able to find this. Would speedstor or diskmanager work for this, I used these programs quite a lot in the XT-days, but I do not have these anymore, Seagate used to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold.   Help will be greatly appreciated.   Ronald Schalk r.schalk@uci.kun.nl
