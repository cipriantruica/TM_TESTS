A circut court judge in Illinois once said  When dealing with a government that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its\' citizenry, one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means to parry this attack on personal privacy.   (Unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar detectors....)  The point remains.  More and more I see the government slowly washing away privacy.  Even unwittingly.  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth?  Do you think I will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they can keep track of what i am saying?  Even if there is no evidence of my guilt?  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle in the affairs of its\' citizenry without recourse of any kind?  i am tired of it.  There is (IMHO) no compromise with an administration that seeks to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy.  More than the proposals themselves, I read the language of the press releases, the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to the public, and I am sickened.  I am revolted.  I am repulsed.  90%, perhaps even 95% of this country could care less about the clipper chip, the wiretap bill, the smart card, because they are so entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration.  This saddens and frightens me.  I am a conserveative believe it or not.  A law and order conserveative. But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me, mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the intelligence of the American people.  Tell them it is going to keep them safe from drug dealers and terrorists, and they will let you put cameras in their home.  Even in the wake of Waco, you find those who support the increasingly totalatarian moves.  >Somebody once said something like:  Armed Violence is meant only to be >used in response to an armed attack.
