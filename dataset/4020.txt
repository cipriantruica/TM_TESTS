From: SHAGBERG@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu Subject: updated keyboard question for the plus  I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc. It came with apple is new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there is a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards do not. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they are such nice people), but they could not tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one is a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you shall fry a board and i  do not want to do .   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple is original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you are right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it is merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.   ***************************************************************** *  Tis the blink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath,        * *  From the blossoms of health, to the paleness of death,       * *  From the gilded saloon, to the briar in the shroud,          * *  O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?                 * *                                                 -William Knox * ***************************************************************** *  shagberg@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu                                    * *****************************************************************
