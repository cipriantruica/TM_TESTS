IDE drives can handle bus speeds > 8 mhz.   I recently bought a Micron 486DX/33 VLB computer and the the local bus ide card was getting around 1k/s transfer rates (says norton).  I caled micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton 6.xx does not recognize local bus and will not give accurate results.  I was told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide transfer speed.  I did not really like this answer in part because the drive does not seem as though it is cranking along at much more than that, but I also do not know if I could tell the difference.  I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS (bus speed at the like) and noticed no significant change in performance.  **B0100000027fed4 Frank Shea  --   Learn of the skillful;\t\t|\tFrank Shea He that teaches himself,\t|\tfas2981@ultb.isc.rit.edu hath a fool for his master \t|\tRochester Institute of Technology  - Ben Franklin\t\t\t|
