From: mss@netcom.com (Mark Singer) Subject: Re: DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME   i am no Kingman fan.  Just thought i had point out that he has the only player in history to have five three-HR games.  Joe Carter has four.  Eddie Murray three.  McCovey and Gehrig also three. Ruth, Mays, Foxx and Dawson two each.  I do not think Reggie is WS game counts, else I believe he would  also have had two.   --\tThe Beastmaster  --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com
