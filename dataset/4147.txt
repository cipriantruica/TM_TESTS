From: hrose@eff.org (Helen Trillian Rose) Subject: Duo 230 slowdown problems  i am a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230 ([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems. Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During this time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away (For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged configuration.  he has re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of these have helped.   it is possible that it is network-related, he uses Eudora which checks his email every 10 minutes (over Ethernet). He has not checked to see if this problem occurs while undocked (he has docked most of the time).   Little to no non-Apple inits, I do not want to start yanking the rest unless I know that might *really* be the problem.   He has not tried zapping the PRAM, I have advised him to do that next.  Anyone who has ideas, i had love to hear about them. i had call Apple, but i have found they are best to call during the week (it is Sunday evening).   [*] Powerbook Duo 230  16/120. 12mb RAM card from Tech Works to replace non-self-refreshing 8mb card. Is using System Enabler 1.0.1. Express Modem (including latest software). Has been to Apple Dealer for Keyboard replacement.  -- Helen Trillian Rose             \t Kapor Enterprises, Inc.            \temail eff@eff.org for EFF Info Electronic Frontier Foundation          Flames to:  Systems and Networks Administration\twomen-not-to-be-messed-with@eff.org
