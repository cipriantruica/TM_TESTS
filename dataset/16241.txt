It assumes that we, at some point, \thad a choice at the ballot box:  Vote yes or no I want the FBI \tand BATF to become latter-day Gestapos .  That just is not so. \tThe process is far more complex.  We do not have direct control over \tthe bureaucracy.  When we evaluate our representatives we do not often \tknow what their contribution is to the wayward direction of the \tfederal law enforcement bureacracy.  To assert that we got what \twe wanted is absurd.    >Waco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious >fanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. do not >blame it on \'them\', the FBI and BATF.

We ARE \'them\'. \tOh, good I feel much better now. ;-)    \tBy the way do you have a plan for getting us out of this mess we \tare in?
