I figure that getting a  decent used bike for under $1K the thing would pay for itself while i am at grad school (car permits are $$$ where i am going and who want is to ride a bus).  i am looking for advice on a first bike - best models/years.  i am NOT looking for an old loud roaring thing that sounds like a monster.  The quit whirring of newer engines is more to my liking.  Apprec any advice.  Thanks,  BS
