I have to admit that when I  see players like Gretzky and Messier traded off to the US because the Canadian teams cannot afford them, I have been know to say (only half- seriously) that we would probably be better off if we had our own Canadian hockey league for Canadian players! ;-)  RA> i am all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let  RA> te Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.

Any of them can put a Leafs\' jersey on if they can put the puck in!  :-)  Stephen Legge SLEGGE@kean.ucs.munc.ca
