Sure, you have already got the right idea.  Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10 ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out 1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly less than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or the availability of parts.  Hows that sound?  \t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad  P.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can be accurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with 100k, which does not load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as keeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.
