Where do they come     The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from  whatever is societally mandated.  it is only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it is a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal.     > Merely a question for the basis of morality  >   > Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.  >    is society    >Depends on the society.     not help.  Is the point irrelevant?  No.  Often the answer is  we are .  But if society is those who make the rules, that is a different question.  If society is who should make the rules, that is yet another.  I do not claim to have the answers, either, but I do not think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things about the US system, at least in principle.     > 2)How do  they  define what is acceptable?      On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).  Well, ideally they do not, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.    > 3)How do we keep from a  whatever is legal is what is  moral   position?    >By adopting a default position that people is moral decisions  >are none of society is business,     how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?  Because sometimes that is necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when it is, and equally importantly, when it is not.    and only interfering when it is truly      Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it is not often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it is a sort of liar is paradox:  force is necessary for freedom .   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom should not object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox does not arise if we do not actively wish to take way anyone is freedom.      The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem   it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem  >to agree that some level of interference is necessary.    They see the need for a  justice  system.  How can we even define that term?  Only by consensus, I guess.     Thus you  >get a situation where  The law often allows what honour forbids , which i have  >come to believe is as it should be.      I admit I do not understand that statement.  What I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may also be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you do not let yourself do it.  Eating meat, for example. --  Frank O\'Dwyer                                  \'i am not hatching That\' odwyer@sse.ie                                  from  Hens ,  by Evelyn Conlon
