From: wier@merlin.etsu.edu (Bob Wier) Subject: Adobe Photoshop Mailing List  i have done a bit of looking, and havn\'t been able to  come up with a mailing list or newsgroup for users of Adobe Photoshop.  Assuming i have just not missed it, i shall go ahead and see if there is enough interest to start a mailing list (and/or alt. newsgroup).  Drop me a note if  you might be interested in subscribing.  THANKS!  --Bob Wier (NOT of the Grateful Dead :-)  ======== insert usual disclaimers here ============   Bob Wier, East Texas State U., Commerce, Texas           Historic Image Processing Project   wier@merlin.etsu.edu (watch for address change)
