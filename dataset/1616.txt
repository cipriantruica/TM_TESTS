From: Brandon.Vanevery@launchpad.unc.edu (Brandon Vanevery) Subject: Company info for graphics software  Within the next several months i shall be looking for a job in computer graphics software.  i am in need of info on graphics software companies.  i have checked the FAQ, the resource list, and siggraph.org, have not found anything.  The last Computer Graphics Career Handbook that i am aware of, was published in 1991.  It has a list of 40 companies in it, but no tremendously specific information on any of them.  Can people please steer me towards more current and in-depth informational resources?  Thanks.  i shall post a summary if there is interest.
