From: atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Cardinal Ximenez) Subject: Dialogue with conservatives wanted     Are there any members of conservative, religious, politically active groups (such as the Christian Coalition) out there?  I come from a very liberal  background, and i had like to talk to some conservative people out there in a  public forum (such as this one.)  I frankly cannot understand the rationale or Christian basis for much of the conservative position, and i had like to try and learn more about this movement--after all, we are part of the same church.  Is anyone interested in explaining a bit about the conservative viewpoint?   Thanks.
