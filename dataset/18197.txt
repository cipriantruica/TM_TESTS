We have no political power whatsoever.        If only that were true.  In California, homosexuals have enough power    to impose their morals on others.      The only  moral  we are imposing is one which you supposedly embrace already:   every human being is right to be treated as such.  I do not expect to be hired based on my sexual orientation.  If someone decides he wants a gay-only staff of employees, that is his business. I will not force him to hire heterosexuals; please do not force me to hire homosexuals.       Therefore, we should be oppressed and ignored and denigrated, right?  I       You are not oppressed in California.      But it is OK to oppress us, that is what you are saying!  No.  i am saying it is none of the government is business what two consenting adults do in private.  You do not believe that, unfortunately.       certainly hope you do not have an SO, sir, because if she heard how      disparaging you are towards political minorities, and if she had any shred      of self-respect, she had be out the door.       Why do you keep insulting women and blacks by comparing them to          This sort of crap makes me so fucking sick that I cannot even bring myself to   touch it.  you are a fuckwit with no perspective, no valid life experience,   and no true knowledge of the human condition.  I see no point in trying to   convince you politely that we are not all like the ones you have met, because   you are showing no willingness at all to be open-minded enough to accept that   your stupid generalizations have exceptions.  You are an intellectual waste,   and the reason you believe the worst of homosexuals is that you bring out   the worst in them.      ----bi    Andrew D. Simchik\t\t\t\t\tSCHNOPIA!  And you are yet another reminder of the emotional instability of homosexuals.  --  Clayton E. Cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer  My opinions, all mine!
