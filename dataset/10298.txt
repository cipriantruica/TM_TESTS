The appearance Antonio,you were not alone.  ABC ratings were very good. I was schocked to hear that ABC is telecast was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National rating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were at 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion from local sports teams. Quite frankly, I expected ABC is ratings to be under 2.0. But i am happy to be proven wrong!  Well,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote control.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble upon a playoff hockey game...  ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give ESPN credit for switching to Detroit is FOX-50 coverage and having Bill Clement at a Pittsburgh is TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis. Maybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings for Sunday is telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion. Good move,ESPN!   -PPV Mark
