From: tomh@metrics.com (Tom Haapanen) Subject: RFD: comp.os.ms-windows.nt.{misc,setup}  This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing the one originally posted in January \'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The proposed groups are described below:  NAME: \t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about \t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.  NAME:\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc STATUS:\t Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT, \t including issues such as security, networking features, console \t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.  RATIONALE: \tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family \tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish \tto argue about the meaning of an  OS ).  The family ranges from \tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to \tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over \t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the \tactual release is slated for May/June \'93.  \tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares \tan application programming interface with the other members of the \tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win- \tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking \tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for \tWindows 3.1.  \tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows \t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses \tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre- \tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced \tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and \tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.  \tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following \tgroups with the other members of the Windows family: \t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps \t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools \t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc \t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32 \t \tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as \twell as Windows 3.1: \t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce \t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy \t \tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the \tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal \tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating \tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have \tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate \tnewsgroup hierarchies.  \tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 -- \twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next- \tgeneration Windows,  Chicago , debuts next year, surely it should \tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus- \ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?   DISCUSSION PERIOD: \tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.    VOTING: \tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on \tthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will \tbe accepted prior to the CFV. --  [ /tom haapanen -- tomh@metrics.com -- software metrics inc -- waterloo, ont ] [        stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull ] [          up.  that is how the corrado makes you feel.   -- car, january \'93 ]
