In Rom : 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. : Note that the passage is not about homosexuality -- it is about : idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at : least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this : passage.  It does not use the word  homosexuality , and it is referring : to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. : So it is not what i had call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.  that is like saying that murder is only wrong for those of us who are not natural murders, and stealing is only wrong for those of us who are not natural thieves.
