Did Bush veto it?  If so, when?          The Brady Bill passed the House in 1992, but failed to reach a vote in the Senate.  As such, it never reached Bush.  (Sarah Brady is condemnation not-withstanding).          it shall probably pass the House again, and will probably pass the Senate if they can get it to a vote.  Whether of not they will be busy with other things will be the question.  I do not expect gung-ho opposition on the part of Senate Republicans, since they will not want to over-use their fillibuster trump card.   --------------------------------------------------------------------- David Veal  University of Tennessee Division of Continuing Education PA146008@utkvm1.utk.edu -  I still remember the way you laughed  When you pushed me down the elevator shaft  ...
