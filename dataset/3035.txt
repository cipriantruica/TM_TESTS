Then do not complain (maybe it was not you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC is because all we have had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus. (ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow) Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when compared to IDE?  >You did not read to carefully.

If >IDE has better throughput, why is not it used on workstations and file >servers?    IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that is how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms.  Is there any argument that  IDE can (or cannot) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?  >: Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive >: controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do >: at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence? >: What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost? > >No, that is the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives >at once.  i have got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  it is pretty ugly.  If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE cannot do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives  at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?  >I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I >have not seen IDE drives cheaper.  A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that is 245 million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?  >No, actually, we are talking about SCSI being expensive simply because >nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: >easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or >Mac), then you had find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  So you are saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type, considering that the vast majority of PC is do not have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC is only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  there is a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.  >: I will not argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented >: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better >: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS is when >: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive. > >On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE?  >But, you bought your PC for >expandibility, so, you had want to add more drives or whatever.  True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.  >\t1.

But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system?  >\t2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac >\tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice >\twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?

After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers, I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive.  >One neat thing that i have noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the >ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with >little problem -- we have got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that i have >added to my PC.  i have now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to >have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive >all on the same card.    That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.  >Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.  But what about  mysterious  (and expensive) drivers to figure out?  At least IDE does not require drivers that consume precious conventional (DOS) memory.
