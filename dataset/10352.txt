From: 35002_2765@uwovax.uwo.ca Subject: CBC: Canadian for ESPN.  Hooray, I hear on TSN that the Jets have won a game, Selanne getting a hat-trick!  Of course, here in GOD\'S COUNTRY (read Ontario!) I could not see that game, nor any other in the VAN-WPG series so far, because our beloved CBC figures no one out here cares about this series (which has looked pretty competitve so far...  On Monday and Wednesday nights, CBC could have shown the Toronto- Detroit game, done the news, then picked up Winnipeg-Vancouver. They did not.  Tonight?  You guessed it, Toronto-Detroit, the news (not the end of the Jets game), then Calgary-LA.  SO, if it is  Hockey Night in Canada , why cannot this Ontarian see one of the two series with two Canadian teams?  Is this too much to ask?  Paul Badertscher 35002_2765@uwovax.uwo.ca
