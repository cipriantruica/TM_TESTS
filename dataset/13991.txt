If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?  This sounds a bit high to me.  Still higher accelerations have been endured *very briefly*, during violent deceleration.  If we are talking sustained acceleration, I think 30-odd gees has been demonstrated using water immersion.  I doubt that any of this generalizes to another order of magnitude. --  All work is one man is work.             | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
