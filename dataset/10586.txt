From: sclark@epas.utoronto.ca (Susan Clark) Subject: Re: Leafs: What happened?  Hi guys....  What happened? \t1.  Potvin did not let six goals by. \t2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up. \t3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs \t\tthe emotional edge. \t4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs.  \tA couple of comments:  \t1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy is not one of the three \tstars does not mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted \tthe playoff point total and he has in something like fifth or sixth \tplace....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for \taccumulating points from the three star selection) during the \tregular season.  \t2.  On the officiating:  i have heard gripes from both ends on this \tone.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is \tone of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the \tofficiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever \tmissed that slash on Gilmour is hand).  \t3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better \tchances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better \tagainst the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the \tdivision). Problem is, I like both these teams, though i am \tsupporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D  \tBy the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not \t\tplaying aggressive hockey.... \tBy the way....i am not any sort of expert, nor do I claim to be. \t\tI just like watching a good matchup.   \ttee hee hee...ooops! \tSusan
