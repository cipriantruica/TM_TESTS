Now *this* is a legitimate point.  Baseball is entertainment, and I have no quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than others, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, i am a huge fan of the slug-bunt; I doubt it is a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of it.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.  Of course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga is inability to defer gratification is not hurting his team because he  is not paid to walk  or  is an RBI guy  or whatever.  >And finally, i had like to point out that many high OBP guys draw  >their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike >to them, than because they have a great  eye   i am not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more i am becoming convinced that it is the other way around: among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot.  let us break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether they are power threats and whether they walk a lot:   \t\t\tPower\t\t\tNo Power  \tPatient\t\tFrank Thomas\t\tBrett Butler \t\t\tBarry Bonds\t\tOzzie Smith \t\t\tMark McGwire\t\tCraig Grebeck \t\t\tBabe Ruth\t\tMiller Huggins \t\t\tTed Williams\t\tBilly Hamilton \t\t\tRickey Henderson\tEddie Joost \t\t\tJoe Morgan\t\tMike Hargrove \t\t\t   .\t\t\t   . \t\t\t   .\t\t\t   . \t\t\t   .\t\t\t   .  \tImpatient\tErnie Banks\t\tOzzie Guillen \t\t\tDave Kingman\t\tShawon Dunston \t\t\tJoe Carter\t\tAndres Thomas \t\t\tGeorge Bell\t\tJose Lind \t\t\tKirby Puckett\t\tDevon White \tetc.  As far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the two are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at the plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being small of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of  target at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example; he has only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all over the place, despite his huge strike zone.   --     David M.
