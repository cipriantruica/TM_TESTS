I did one yesterday on my shaftie Vision... I should mention   that I had a pillon that helped rotate the bike over :-) . The wheelie was   the result of a necessarily agressive acceleration manouver through an   intersection (damn San Antonio cagers tend to be REALLY bad drivers).    \tHowever, I have done one by myself, it just takes a lot of   pre-clutch dump rev action.  \tjust a passing comment \tjohnny@ennex1.eng.utsa.edu
