Hey, I do not approve the behavior of these guys, especially not in a WC game, but I cannot see any reason for using the word \'Nazi\' in this connection.     |> But-Us-Germans-Sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitude |> in every possible sport (remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer)  Soccer hooligans are not just a German problem (remember the world cup in Italy). Again: there is a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shop-windows or fighting with other so-called \'fans\', who come to a WC just to see if the Dutch or the English or the Germans are the best bruisers. Which other sports are you talking about? I do not think soccer is \'every possible sport\'.  |> It really pisses me off! |> I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks, but  |> most of them seem to do...  How many Germans do you know? Do you think 200 out of 10000 is \'most of them\'?  If you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the US, what do you think about the Americans? \'Most of them\' like beating blacks?  |>  |> \tJokke Kylmaoja |> \tgolf@phoenix.oulu.fi |>     Robert
