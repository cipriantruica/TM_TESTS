Oh PULLEEZE!  it is not biology at all, it is clothing design.  Women is clothing is generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  it is only been in the last five years or so that you could buy women is pants with pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were virtually unknown in women is clothing.  Skirts generally have better pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty hopeless.  I often hand my driver is license over to my husband if we are dressed up to go out somewhere, so I do not have to be encumbered by a purse.  If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the manufacturers who refuse to make functional women is clothing, I think manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  there is an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi is Backlash that described what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the need for functional women is clothing.  The manufactuing industry lost millions.
