There has been much more racist stuff in the past.  Why are we expected to listen to it and remain  calm?   I do not think that listening to racist or anti-semetic slurs is an incitement to calm debate.  \tPerhaps you do not mean to be coming off as highly offensive. However, the way you have posted seems to be typical of those who have an irrational dislike for Israel and Jews.  Perhaps if you took a close look at what you have posted thought a bit about the combatative tone you have used, you would see why people are reacting the way they are.
