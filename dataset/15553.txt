We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing:  Marvel Alan> not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again  (John 3:7).

Yes, but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement in the same conversation:   Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.  (John 3:6)  Clearly infants are not born of the spirit.  Thus, without baptism they are unspiritual.  They are not born with the image of God, but in Adam is fallen image (cf. Gen 5:3).  They have no righteousness of their own, just as adults have no righteousness of their own.  There is only the imputed righteousness of Christ, which believers receive through faith.  Alan> 3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the Alan> concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies Alan> were not free from sin?  Your point is a little obscure here, but I think you are saying that Christ used the  innocence  of newborn babes as a metaphor for spiritual re-birth.  But this is not what he did. If you look at the text, he did not speak of spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth.  We are born of the Spirit once, not twice or several times. We are also born of the flesh once.  The Lord makes it clear that these are separate and different events. It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual birth as re-birth because it is a second birth (for example, Titus 3:5).  But it is not a second *spiritual* birth.  The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth, which is used as a symbol of `new life\' -- not of innocence.  When an infant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither innocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual is baptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a new life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians 2:5).  Then the believer has God is assurance of the forgiveness of their sins, and of Christ is imputed righteousness.
