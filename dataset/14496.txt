In   14:1 resonance with WHAT?  it is not like there is any wavelength or frequency to the Earth is gravitational field.

The only way I can see gravitational effects being useful in adding energy to an object orbiting Earth is some sort of interaction with the moon. --  *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)\t*       ___ *\t\t\t\t\t* _____/_o_ _____ *\tTwinkle, twinkle, little .sig,\t*(==(/_______ )==) *\tKeep it less than 5 lines big.\t*  == /      /==/
