From: robichau@lambda.msfc.nasa.gov (Paul Robichaux) Subject: Suggestions for escrow agencies (was: Re: More technical details)  ( Below is my response to Dr. Denning is letter to Steven Bellovin. Comments   are invited. - Paul )  In alt.privacy.clipper, Steve Bellovin posted your message to him, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies as escrow agencies.  I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow agencies will not be law enforcement agencies. I would argue, however, that *one* of the escrow agencies should not be federal at all.  As a private citizen, I would feel much more  secure in my person and papers  knowing that an organization committed to individual civil liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or overtly controlled by the government.  Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you mentioned, I have the following comments:  \t- SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have         great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not         convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_ \tinformation, since in any case requiring disclosure, there is       \tlikely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly  \t*wrongful* disclosure.  \t- GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of  \ttheir fidelity and ability.  \t- *TREASURY*? Surely you are joking. Perhaps you had ask BATF \tto safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a  \tbetter choice.  Ever since last fall is  trial balloon  was posted in sci.crypt, your name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.  I agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always* act properly. However, there have been enough cases where _sworn agents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel that having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.
