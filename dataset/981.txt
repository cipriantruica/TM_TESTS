From: greg@cs.uct.ac.za (Gregory Torrance) Subject: Automatic layout of state diagrams  Hi,  i am hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science project group. We are doing computer science honours, and our project is to do a \'graphical simulator for a finite state automata\'.  Basically, the program must draw a diagram of a FSA from a textual grammar, showing circles for states, and labeled arc is in-between.  The problem is working out the best way to layout the states, and draw the arc is in-between so that as few arc is as possible cross each other.  If anyone has any suggestions/algorithms/bug-free ready to compile C code :)  that might help us, it would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance,  Gregory
