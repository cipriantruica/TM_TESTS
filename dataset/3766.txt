Just thought people might > want to know.....  there is absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time  _alone_ would cause an incompatibility.  There would have to be another  difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem.  i have often used  memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever.  As long as it is as fast (or faster) than the minimum requirement you should be fine.  Just out of curiosity, did you actually try this and see a problem, or  were you told it would not work and so never tried it?  Also out of  curiosity, do you know exactly who in Cupertino you dealer talked to (as  i had like to find out what they are basing this recommendation on).  - Dale Adams   Apple Computer, Inc.
