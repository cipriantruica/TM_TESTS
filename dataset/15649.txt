There was a > demand, so an entire industry formed to supply it.  \tIf alcohol were again banned today, it would be MUCH more \tdifficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation.  \tThe cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military \tin communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.  \tIn a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into \tthis country has greatly decreased. This is because its \tvalue-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or \theroin. it is simply not worth the risk, it is uneconomical. \tNow, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on \tthe domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and \tthus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer \tis now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way. \tYou cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a \tgood dollar/pound deal.   \tFirearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area. \tIt would not be economic to smuggle them in. All production \twould have to be local. There are not all that many people \twho have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile \tfirearms from scratch. High-ranking crime figures could \tobtain imported Uzis and such, but the average person, and \taverage thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would \tpay through the nose for it.
