From: matthews@oswego.Oswego.edu Subject: MG T-series FOR SALE   1954 MG-TF with frame-up restoration in early \'70 is - a local show winner! Driven very little and stored inside since then - mostly collected dirt & dust.  Needs attention to brake cylinders (like all MG-T is) but otherwise ready to run.  Chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent. The engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop.  It is priced at $12,000.  1953 MG-TD Good shape but has not been run since \'70 is.  Needs engine work, but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and carpet that were new and have not seen the outdoors since the \'70 is. $9,500.  1952 MG-TD Basket Case.  i had call it a parts car, but it is too good for that.  Everything seems to be there except the tach.  Would make a good project car or parts car if you insist.  No apparent rust but the upholstery is a disaster.  Stored inside since the \'70 is.  The top was new but now soso.  This one has wire wheels!  Looking for $4,500.  All three cars will be sold  as they stand  with no hassles or haggles. Time has passed by and it is time to part company.  Prices are negotiable.  Reply via matthews@Oswego.oswego.edu or   U.S. mail to: P. O.
