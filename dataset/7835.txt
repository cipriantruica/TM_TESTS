From: meb4593@galileo.rtn.ca.boeing.com (Michael Bain) Subject: What about No-Fault?   Insurance companies sure seem to go for No-Fault coverage.  Since the majority of accidents are the cagers\' fault, does not this imply that we would have to pay much higher rates under a No-Fault system?  With a cars-only system, it seems to make sense on the surface: take the legal costs out of the system.  But it looks like motorcyclists would get screwed.   --  Michael  Chuck  Bain                       meb4593@icdfs.ca.boeing.com   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- \t\t      Semi-Loud Pipes Save Lives
