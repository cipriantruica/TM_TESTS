From: wagner@grace.math.uh.edu (David Wagner) Subject: Re: Deuterocanonicals, esp. Sirach  ddavis@cass.ma02.bull.com (Dave Davis) writes:   \tII. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because  \t\tthey are not quoted by the NT authors.  That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.    Dave also writes:  III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because  \t\tthey teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)  \t\tparts of the canon.    \tthen I answer:   \t\tThese is a logically invalid *a priori*.   \t\tBesides, we are talking about OT texts-   \t\twhich in many parts are superceded by the NT  \t\t(in the Xtian view). Would not this same  \t\tprinciple exclude _Ecclesiastes_?  \t\tThis principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn  Now Thank We All Our God  quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church is history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends.  David H.
