From: cmmiller@iastate.edu (C. M. Miller) Subject: RESULTS of Mathematica Speed Tests!!  Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to this newsgroup.  The  test  was the following command:  >Plot3D[((-2*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-5000)^2+(y-8000)^2+ >81000000)^1.5))+((-3*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-10000)^2+ >(y-1000)^2+81000000)^1.5))+((4*2000)/(2*3.1416* >((x-7000)^2+(y-10000)^2+4000000)^1.5)), >{x,-5500,19500},{y,-5500,19500},PlotPoints->50]   I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and workstations.  The results are posted below:  Machine\t\tSystem\t\tMath vers.\t  of trials\ttime, min  PB 170\t\t7.0.0 with\t2.1\t\t2\t\t2:08 \t\ttuneup/8MB \t\tRAM/5MB for \t\tMathematica  DEC 5000\tUltrix v4.2a\t2.1 for\t\t1\t\t0:25 \t\tDEC RISC\t \t\t\t\t\t IIsi\t\t7.1/cache@96MB\t1.2f33Enh.\t1\t\t4:30 \t\t25MHz/5MB RAM/ \t\t3MB for Math./ \t\tw/ 68882  C650\t\t7.1/8MB RAM\t\t\t2\t\t0:32  Q800\t\t8MB/Cache@384/\t1.2\t\t\t\t1:01 \t\t4MB for Math.\t  Sparc\t\tSunOS4.1.3\t\t\t\t\t0:14 Station\t\t40MB RAM  SGI Iris/4D\tR3000 RISC\t\t\t\t\t<0:01 \t\tprocessor \t\tversion  Sparc\t\tSunOS4.1.2\t2.1 \t\t\t\t0:26 Station2  IIsi\t\t7.1\t\t\t\t\t\t3:15  NeXT\t\tNeXTSTEP 2.1\t1.2\t\t\t\t2:38 Cube\t\t68030 based/ \t\tw/ coprocessor\t  NeXT\t\tNeXTSTEP 3.0\t1.2\t\t5(ave)\t\t0:52 Cube\t\t68040/25MHz/ \t\t20 MB RAM  IIsi\t\t17MB/8MB for\t2.102 Enha\t\t\t3:15 \t\tMath.\t\t\t \t\tw/ 68882  NeXT\t\t16MB RAM/\t\t\t1 \t\t0:37 \t\t25 MHz 040/ \t\tWorkspace \t\tManager 2.1  Funny how the IIsi running at 25 MHz is slower than other equivalent machines, lots slower in fact.  Perhaps the version of Mathematica makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated. Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it.  Wow.   Basically, though, I would not draw any conclusions from this data.  It seems that Mathematica is speed is dependant on a lot of variables.  I was just curious how different machines would measure up.    Well, if you have any questions or if I forgot something, just drop me a line at  cmmiller@iastate.edu .    Chad  PS  If the spacing of the above table does not come out right on your machine, tell me and i shall mail you a copy of this in a binhexed Word 5.1 document.
