For example, persistent hepatitis vs chronic >hepatitis.  I do not think there is a general distinction.  Rather, there are two classes of chronic hepatitis: chronic active hepatitis and chronic persistent hepatitis.  I cannot think of any other disease where the term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.  Much as these two terms  chronic active  and  chronic persistent  sound fuzzy, the actual distinction between the two conditions is often fairly fuzzy as well. --  David Rind rind@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu
