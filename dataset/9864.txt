I think this guy is going to be just a little bit disappointed.  Lemieux two, Tocchet, Mullen, Tippett, and Jagr.  I buzzed my friend because I forgot who had scored Mullen is goal.  I said,  Who scored?  Lemieux two, Tocchet, Tippett, Jagr.   The funny part was I said the  Jagr  part non-chalantly as he was in the process of scoring while I was asking this question!!! :-)  All in all ABC is coverage was not bad.  On a scale of 1-10, I give it about an 8.  How were the games in the Chi/St. Louis/LA area???  >it is nice that the Devils are starting out their playoffs on network >television ... too bad that their playoff game has been preempted on >WABC-AM for an early-season Yankees baseball game!  that is stupid!!!  i had complain to the television network!  If I were to even see a Pirates game on instead of a Penguins game at this time of the year, I and many other Pittsburghers would surely raise hell!!!  >it is a 12-2 win by the Texas Rangers ... and they are delaying the >tape-delay by another half-hour for the ballgame  highlights !!!  Texas is off to a good start, they may pull it out this year.  Whoops!  That belongs in rec.sport.baseball!!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Robbie Po **          PGH PENGUINS!!!     We do what comes naturally! Patrick Division Semi is  \'91 STANLEY CUP    You see now, wait for the PENGUINS 6, Devils 3     \'92 CHAMPIONS      possibility, do not you see a Penguins lead, 1-0       12 STRAIGHT WINS!  strong resemblance... -DG \'89
