In Chicago they were doing lobe transplants from >living donors, and i am sure they have published.      The case report of the first xenotransplant was published in Lancet 1993; 341:65-71. I can send you a reprint if you are interested. There was  another paper, sort of a tour of the horizon, written by Starzl and published in the Resident is Edition of the Annals of Surgery (vol 216, October 1992). it is in the Surgical Resident is Newsletter section, so you will not find it in the regular issue of the Annals. I do not have any reprints of that one. A paper has been accepted for publication by Immunology Today, though i am not sure when it is coming out, describing our experience with the two xenografts done to date.   As for segmental liver transplants from living related donors I must confess to a total ignorance of that literature. We are philosophically opposed to those, and I do not keep  up with that particular field.  =====================================================  Howard Doyle doyle+@pitt.edu
