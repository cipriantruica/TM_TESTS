From: jennise@opus.dgi.com (Milady Printcap the goddess of peripherals) Subject: Looking for a little research help   Hi,      i am writing a science fiction script and i am looking for some answers to questions regarding the Moon and Earth. My starting point is an impossible situation.  [I checked with a professor at berkeley and his response was a VERY helpful  cannot happen .] If you enjoy playing with unusual ideas and are willing answer some questions please contact me via e-mail (jennise@dgi.com).    I get extremely annoyed when screen and tele-plays ignore basic facts about computers that i am determined to be as scientifically accurate as I can.     Sorry for being vague, but i had like to protect my idea as much as I can until i am ready to sell it (hopefully).  Jennise
