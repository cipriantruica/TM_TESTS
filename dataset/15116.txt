From: ka2czu@cbnewsh.att.com Subject: Christians in the Martial Arts  Greetings and Salutations!  I would like to get in touch with people who (a) consider themselves Christians (you define it), and (b) are in the Martial Arts  Some topics for discussion: \t- your particular martial art \t- your view of the relationship between \t\tChristianity and your art \t- your view of the relationship between \t\t*your* Christianity and your art \t- why should a Christian participate in MA \t- why should not a Christian participate in MA \t- Biblical views of MA; pro or con.  For example, I heard from one fellow: \t ...I tried the Karate for Christ thing and it was not for me...  \t- why or why not?  As an aside, I am involved (in *NO* official way) with an organization called the Christian Black Belt Association and I would also like to distribute info regarding upcoming events to *those who are interested*.  No, you will not be put on any  mailing list  nor will your name be  sold .  However, if you ARE intested in an email list, let me know.  I am interested in email replies ONLY as this is cross-posted  to groups I do not normally read.  If anyone wants a summary or, of course, on-going discussion, then let me know.   Shalom, Robert Switzer ka2czu@cbnewsh.att.com --  Bell Labs, 200 Laurel Ave., 2b-334, Middletown, NJ 07748-4801 USA (908)957-2923 ...-.-    Amateur Radio Operator           KA2CZU   Robert Switzer
