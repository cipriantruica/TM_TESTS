You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it is hard to digest anyway.   For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal  last  longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How tight are your clothes. You should not be wearing any clothing that compresses  your middle. Be sure not to  suck in  your stomach when sitting, again it will put pressure on the digestive tract.   Try laying on your sides, back, and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive. Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby  turn  or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months. When you are shortwaisted it is easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my second one to do over again I think i had have tried to loosen up since he did not turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.   Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she is young.  But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible.   Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My first pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble. Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby.
