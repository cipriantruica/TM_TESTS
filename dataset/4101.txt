From: feilimau@leland.Stanford.EDU (Christopher Yale Lin) Subject: Mac IIsi Cache options  Readers,  I have found that the cache upgrade options for the Mac IIsi include the following:\t1) AE QuickSilver \t\t2) Daystar Fastcache IIsi \t\t3) Daystar ComboCache IIsi \t\t4) LogiCache IIsi 64k cache  i had be interested in hearing opinions on any or all of these options. The other alternative is to upgrade to a CPU accelerator such as the LogiCache 50 MHz. Ideas, comparisions?  felix lin feilimau@leland.stanford.edu
