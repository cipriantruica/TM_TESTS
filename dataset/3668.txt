From: jrl8@cunixa.cc.columbia.edu (James R Lendino) Subject: Notebooks  I posted this once but did not receive any responses.  i have been looking for a good notebook for about $1700.  My two favorites are the Zeos Freestyle/SL and the Micro something or other Winbook (the one with the Apple Powerbook style trackball and handrest and the 486SLC).  Any suggestions on others?  i had love to hear from someone who has one of the two mentioned above, too.  Thanks in advance, -JRL                       ______ James R.
