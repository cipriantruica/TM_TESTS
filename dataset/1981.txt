From: brettw@matt.ksu.ksu.edu (Brett D. Watson) Subject: Which sound board to buy?    Well, i have come into some money and want to buy CD-ROM, sound board and speakers.  I have not kept up on any material relating to sound boards and CD-ROM is because until now I never thought i had have enough money.      So can you guru is out there point me in the direction of a good package including CD-ROM, sound, and speakers (and software I suppose)... OR since I do not REALLY need the CD-ROM right now give me some good ideas for sound boards and speakers.  Those I could REALLY use now.  I have looked at SoundBlaster Pro, which costs about as much as I think I want to spend on a board (~$120), and i have looked at the Gravis Sound board, which is about $140 and I do not know the adv/disadv of either of these boards.      Right now I want to use it with any games that support sound, and to use in Windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there.  So any concise info on sound boards, complete multimedia packages, etc would be greatly appreciated.  If anyone else is interested in this info I would be glad to summarize responses and post.      And if this is some type of FAQ please point me in the right direction and do not bother taking up a lot of bandwidth.  Thanks!  -=- Brett --  Brett Watson, Database/System Administrator Kansas Supreme Court - Topeka, KS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
