Covington  I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few years back and I cannot cite the specifics.  I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded to Watt is comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave to man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the true conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to *conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of *conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in  which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate to one another and to God.  IMHO, Watt is stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served  on the board of directors for Jim Bakker is organization, during a time in  which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker  in federal prison.  Bob rgolder@hoh.mbl.edu Just another Baptist...
