From: gt5735a@prism.gatech.EDU (Mark Devaney) Subject: Sorry, another Gateway posting   I never thought i had contribute to a Gateway thread, either pro or con, but my spleen could use a little venting.  The scenario:  \t1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller \t2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy) \t3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy) \t4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days  \t\t(getting happier) \t5 - New controller does not work (unhappy again) \t6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days \t\t\t(cooling off, the end is in sight) \t7 - This controller does not work either, motherboard is bad \t\t(VERY unhappy)  Gateway is solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days) \tand have on-site service install it for me. BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way i have already blown about 20 hours with this, about 10 of them on hold and I do not have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and i have only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole  thing is going back.     I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.  I would really like to try Gateway again, i am just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but i am beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is booming, and for good reason, but I do not know if I can take it again. Oh well, I feel better now...  --  -----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____----- | Mark Devaney                     - Hear me now and believe me later     | | Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta Georgia, 30332\t\t  | | Internet: markd@cc.gatech.edu   \t\t\t\t\t  |
