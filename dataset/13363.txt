I was not trying to tell you not to eat MSG products and produce, nor was I arguing for or against MSG. I was simply questioning the logic of your statement that simply because (a) one is not allergic to something, and (b) likes eating that it follows that one could keep eating whatever it is.  In my post, I had clearly said that I do not know enough about MSG. The statement  do not eat X because its bad  is just _your_  interpretation of nutritional info out there.  Prakash Das
