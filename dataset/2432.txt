Maybe  PC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance management programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you cannot find them at your library.  i have been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though i have not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:  \tThe ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts: \tchecking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile \tyour account statements with the records the program keeps.  \tThe ability to make a budget and track your spending against that \tbudget.  \tA Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill \tpaying service to pay your bills via your modem. \t \tThe ability to print checks on your printer.  \tThe ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.  \tThe ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts \tup to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically \tvia modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but i am not sure about it.  \tThe ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation \tprograms.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:  \tA tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to \tpredict your tax liability for the coming year.  it is usefull to fine \ttune your withholding so Uncle Sam does not get his due too early.  \tAn insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep \trecords of your insurance policies as well as other vital records. \tIt can also compute your life expectancy.  \tA financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,  \teffects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to \tmaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and \tloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you  \tdecide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford \ta particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good \tinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether \ta particular investment is cash flow is adequate for your situation. \tThis module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping \tyour kids with their tuition.    \tA net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets \tand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this  \tinformation.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules \tare automatically included here.  \tA  desk  module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file \tyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital \tinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a \trudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment \tlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to \ttrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list \tcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but i am almost sure that Quicken does not do everything i have listed.  If i am wrong, i am sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version of Managing Your Money for release late this year.  I hope this information is of use to you.  i have found Managing Your Money to be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other hand I know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has all the features you need or want, i had go with it. If you find any of the Managing Your Money features that Quicken does not have to be useful, I think it is well worth the price.
