In any case, to claim as Greg did, >that Gainey *never* made  a technical mistake is absolutely >ludicrous.   Later on, in your posting, you make reference to  putting words into other people is mouths ...I would suggest that your last paragraph can only be interpreted in one way...namely, that I, along with Greg, claim that Gainey never made a technical mistake.  If you actually read what i have written, you will find that I make no such claim...soooo, if logic serves me well, you are contradicting yourself.   >>>Gainey was a plugger.

Roger, i am not sure here, but I think  ignorance  is really a function of  a lack of knowledge  and not  formulating an opinion ...but hey, if you need to take a cheap shot, then by all means go ahead...that is if it makes you feel better.   >>I think Gainey would be honoured to know that you have included >>him   >I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is >remembered at  all.     My word, such vehemence against poor ol\' Bob Gainey.  Why does he bother you so much...he was an effective player for his style of play.   >>on this list.  I also think you have a relatively naive view >>about what wins a hockey game...pluggers are an integral part >>of   >Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  And that >is simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to >go  around.  Who would you rather have as your  checking  >centre?  Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would >take either Gretzky or Mario as my  checking  centres.  Do you >think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey?    i am really sorry Roger, but you have lost me completely here.  Why do not you ask me if I would rather have Jesus Christ, himself, in nets?   Now, if you were to compare, say for example, Bob Gainey with Guy Carbonneau, you would have a balanced comparison.   >>any team.  The Selke is designed to acknowledge their >>contribution...I think that most people understand that it is >>not the Nobel Prize...so settle down.   >you are wrong again.  The Selke is awarded to the forward that >does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the >best plugger.  If  Gilmour does the best defensive job in the >league I do not see why he  should be out of the running simply >because he also contributes offen-sively.   i am wrong AGAIN...hmmm, let us see...where was I wrong in the first place?  i am only guessing here, Rog, but I have a feeling that you have setup a  you are wrong again  macro key on your machine.   I agree that my use of the word plugger is simplistic...but I think you know what i am getting at.  I would also like to point out that Gilmour is potential as a Selke-winner was never part of the debate...are you asking me for an opinion?  If so, I think there are far too many other deserving players to include Gilmour among the candidates.   >>Settle down?  If you think that I have likened the Selke to the >>Nobel prize then I suggest that you had best  settle down .  >>And if you are going to try to put words in my mouth, let me >>suggest that you  settle  down  before you bother following up >>on my postings.    I would suggest that your comment:  And when the press runs out of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa Tikkannen, Butch Goring, Bob Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek Sanderson, Wayne Cashman, Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri Richard, Dick Duff...and so on...  demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the game...so yes, settle down...nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods.   >>congenially, as always, >>  >>jd >>  >>-- >>James David >>david@student.business.uwo.ca   >You might consider developing your own style.
