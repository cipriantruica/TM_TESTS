So these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of their circumstances (their genetics, their environment, their experiences) which are not all self-determined?  (Of course, the idea of Hell makes the idea of  free will  dubious. On the other hand, the idea of Hell is not a very powerful idea.  \t A Parable for You  \t There was once our main character who blah blah blah. \t One day, a thug pointed a mean looking gun at OMC, and said, \'Do what I say, or i am blasting you to hell.\' \t OMC thought, \'If I believe this thug, and follow the instructions that will be given, i shall avoid getting blasted to hell.  On the other hand, if I believe this thug, and do not follow the instructions that will be given, i shall get blasted to hell.  Hmm... the more attractive choice is obvious, i shall follow the instructions.\'  Now, OMC found the choice obvious because everything OMC had learned about getting blasted to hell made it appear very undesirable. \t But then OMC noticed that the thug is gun was not a real gun.  The thug is threats were make believe. \t So OMC ignored the thug and resumed blah blah blah. ) --  qpliu@princeton.edu           Standard opinion: Opinions are delta-correlated.
