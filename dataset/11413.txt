The feds, unlike Apple, have repeatedly demonstrated that trust is an unsafe thread on which to hang your freedom. Why?  Because unlike Apple in (2), the govt has no credibility to lose. i am serious about this. One can name just about any agency -- the IRS, RTC, FCC, FAA, FBI, NSA, CIA -- and find numerous examples of the public trust run roughshod over. Worse, one can rarely find in such  examples any serious consequences to the offending agency. Even supposing we could get a reign on trust somehow, there is always the matter of competence in govt agencies. Can they even trust themselves?    -mel    P.S. I was amused when you mentioned the USDA as an example of an agency capable of managing the an escrow. i am a consultant to the USDA, and while those *I* work with are wonderful , the agency itself is ranked in industry publications such as Govt Computer News as one of the worst caretakers of its computer resources. Recently, Prime Time Live did a long segment on the USDA is computer troubles. They are making a concerted effort to change, but intentions do not make a track record.  ________________________________________________________________________ | Mel beckman                  |   Internet: mbeckman@mbeckman.com     | | Beckman Software Engineering | Compuserve: 75226,2257                | | Ventura, CA 93003            |  Voice/fax: 805/647-1641 805/647-3125 | |______________________________|_______________________________________|   You can observe a lot just by watching.   -Yogi Bera
