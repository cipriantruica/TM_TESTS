From: Brandon.Vanevery@launchpad.unc.edu (Brandon Vanevery) Subject: 3d graphics software company info?  Within a few months, i shall be looking for a job in 3d computer graphics software.  i am in need of info on companies that do it.  there is nothing in any of the FAQ is for this group, and nothing at siggraph.org (at least I could not find anything.)  The last Computer Graphics Career Handbook was dated 1991, had info on 40 companies, but nothing specific on any of them.  Can people please direct me towards more current and detailed sources of information?  i shall post a summary of sources if there is interest.  Also, could you please e-mail me, our news server is on the fritz. :(  Thanks, Brandon  --    The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the University of      North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Campus Office for Information         Technology, or the Experimental Bulletin Board Service.            internet:  laUNChpad.unc.edu or 152.2.22.80
