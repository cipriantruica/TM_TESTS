So why does not she appear to me? i am a little weak in the blind faith department. (Besides, she does not even really need to appear: how about, oh say, a little tip - something like  put your all on   in the 7:30 at the Dog Races  ... perhaps in a dream or vision.)  >>How do we know that >>Muhammed did not just go out into the desert and smoke something?  > >Would a person who was high write so well and with such consistency?  i am afraid I do not know arabic; I have only read translations. I would not know it if it were well-written. (Consistent, though, is one thing the Quran is not.)  And have *you* read it in arabic?  Besides, some of my best writing has been done under the influence of, shall we say, consciousness altering substances.  >>And how >>do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to did not screw up, or >>put in their own little verses?  > >they would have to be very good to do so without destroying the beauty >and literary quality of text Arabic text.   Yes, so? How do we know they *were not* very good? (Again, assuming that the Quran is beautfully written.)  >>And why can Muhammed marry more than four women,  >>when no other muslim is allowed to?  > >Muhammad did not exceed the number _after_ the revelation regulating >the number of wives a man could marry, but before it.  Ok, I retract this point.

But I cannot take it on your say-so - what are your sources?  >Another case of judging principles on the basis of those who claim >to follow them.  What other basis do we have to judge a system? Especially when we cannot get a consistent picture of what Islam  really  is. Do I believe Khomeini? Do I go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca? Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey? Or perhaps you say I should go only by the Quran. Ok, whose translation? And what about things like  And wherever you find idolators, kill them ?  -s --   Shamim Mohamed / {uunet,noao,cmcl2..}!arizona!shamim / shamim@cs.arizona.edu    Take this cross and garlic; here is a Mezuzah if he has Jewish; a page of the     Koran if he has a Muslim; and if he has a Zen Buddhist, you are on your own.
