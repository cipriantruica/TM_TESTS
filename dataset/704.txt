Yup, I think you are right.  My mistake.  Now, how do I make an  R  backwards using a computer keyboard?  i shall bet the gods know how (this is alt.atheism, after all).  Tell you what, if all my  R s start coming out backwards when I type from now on, i shall become a believer.  (And that is not asking for miracles.  If I asked for a miracle, i had ask for a real miracle, like for Pat Buchanan to become an out-of-the-closet drag queen - well...maybe that would not be so miraculous, but I think he had look fabulous in a feather boa and a sequined hat like Mia Farrow wore in Gatsby.)
