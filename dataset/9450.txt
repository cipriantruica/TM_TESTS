I DID NOT WRITE THAT!  In fact, those statements were a rebuttal to an earlier posting that I made, and this was culled from my *strong* rebuttal to those statements.  PLEASE!  Slander.  Shame.   >There is a fine line between  getting players\' input  and  knuckling >under to players\' demands.

After the employees leave the workplace, it does not matter what they say about the boss or the company?  Puhlease.   >Strawberry is demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like >demands.

That seems like >a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question  >like,  How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?    First, it is Ross Porter.  Second, I am really tired of seeing the kind of response that indicates that all I do is parrot what some media person says or writes.  I have a brain.  If I choose to characterize something in a certain fashion, it is because that is what I believe to be accurate.  It is not just because some unnamed  mediot  made the characterization.    >A more media-sensitive player might answer  The manager knows what he is >doing.

I did *not* brand Darryl is response as petulant, because I never heard any response from Darryl.  I did call him a name.  I referred to him  as a primadonna.  Someone else concluded that I did that because I  hate  him.  I do not hate him.  I think he has a primadonna.  If you disagree, fine.  But stop putting words in my mouth.    --\tThe Beastmaster > >   --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com
