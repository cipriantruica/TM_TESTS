From: tsmith@cerritos.edu Subject: Wanted: Searching for music videos  I am currently searching for old video tapes of music groups of the early 80 is to the late 80 is.  At first I requested VHS formats, but now i am accepting either VHS, 8MM, OR BETA.  The type of format i am interested in are the type that most nite clubs or trendy clothing stores play.  If you do have any of these tapes just send me a reply with a few groups listed, i shall reply back if the groups listed are the type i am searching for.  i shall gladly pay you what they are worth or trade for other movie or music videos, thanks.  Tom. ________________________________________________________________________________                  /|                /                                                            /                                                                             /  |               _______________________________                            /                   | You are now leaving the     |                          /    |               | state of southern CALIFORNIA|                          /                     | Please buckle up.
