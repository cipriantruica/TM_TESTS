The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder  The May 1993 cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without any solder mask (you can tell from the copper colored traces). The box labeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflon/glass board, while the one in the center has the grayish board exposed.  On the left is some  fiberglass board that looks green to me.  I see no reason for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers :-).  I wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their low noise microwave preamps?  Often, microwave circuits have odd bits of wire/foil/metal attached to wherever/whatever is necessary to make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product?).  A solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher, never mind  the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits.  (Q dope for coils *does* not improve the Q--it just holds things together with minimal loss).
