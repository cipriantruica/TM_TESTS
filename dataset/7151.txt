If you can get a  body in decent shape the mechanicals should all be available _somewhere_ -  Checker used whatever parts were around.  For instance, I had a Chevy straight six and a GMC Truck radiator and a Ford rear in mine.  > >The model that I am looking for is the Checker Marathon.  \tActually, you want a Checker Special if you can find one.  \tGood luck.  i am sorry I let mine go...
