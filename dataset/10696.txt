That way they can start a tap, get the serial number, and use the warrant for the first tap to get the key.  \tIf they tap someone who has apparently using encryption, but do not find that prefix, then they will assume it is an  un-authorized  encryption scheme.  -- \tMay the Kloo Gnomes be generous to you.
