From:  Subject: Daystar Turbo 040 Opinions?  i am thinking about upgrading my 030 50MHz to the 040 33version.  Has anyone had any experience with the accelerator, and if so - what do you think? Any problems, what are the speedometer results?, is it much faster than the 50MHz?  Basically, i had appreciate hearing all about this product.  Please respond via email, and i shall summarize if there is a big response.  thanks in advance, Andrew
