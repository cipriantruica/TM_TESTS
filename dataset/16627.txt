If there were no attacks in the security zone for a year because the Lebanese army could maintain the peace, then Lebanon would be in much better shape.  \tTell me something, though.  Why do Syrian troops not get attacked?  are not they occupying Lebanon?  \tIsrael has repeatedly stated that it will leave on two conditions.  One is a demonstration that the Lebanese army can keep the peace.  The second is that the Syrians pull out as well.
