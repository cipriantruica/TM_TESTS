Right now 32 bit is kinda aesthetically a pain in a few places because of hacks upon hacks to maintain compatibility with original QD---I think of things like where you have to cast CGrafPorts to GrafPorts and such. It would be a lot cleaner to ditch this entire mess and start over---do we get that?  Maynard
