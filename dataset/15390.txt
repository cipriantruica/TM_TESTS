From: whitsebd@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu (Bryan Whitsell) Subject: Homosexuality  Recently an e-mail to me mentioned:  (Technically, the messengers are not even human so it *cannot* be a case of  homosexuality  -- even of rape.) [...]  The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of the Sodomites\'  lust  for the  other flesh  of angels.  Again, application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of gay Christians is largeely specious. *** Are angels  flesh ? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).  what are other opinons on this? I have not heard much about this verse   at all.  In Christ is Love, Bryan --
