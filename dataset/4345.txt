From: folsom@cup.portal.com (Keith E Folsom) Subject: LCIII Logic Board Re-work  I purchased an LCIII recently and had heard a bit about a re-work of the logic board.  I opened mine up and found the same re-work, with a small chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two  other chips.  i had like to know more about it.  Could anyone with any or all of the following information please post it?  Thanks a bunch.  1.\tWhat does the re-work accomplish (i.e., what does it fix)? 2.\tWhat are the technical details of the re-work?  (i am looking for \tthings such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected, \tand the pin-outs for those chips.) 3.\tIs a board with the re-work any different functionally from one without? 4.\tCould the re-worked boards be incompatible with future releases of \tthe operating system?  \tand, finally,  5.\tShould I even be concerned about any of this?
