That makes real sense.  Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to memory with a \'rep insw\' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 was not cached, the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and it is possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for \'computing\') as does the \'rep insw\' sequence.  The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really does stink.  Wally Bass
