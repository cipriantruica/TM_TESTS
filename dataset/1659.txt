Be warned, the data content is high and brings many packages to their knees. We use it primarily for MicroStation but it exports DXF, as well as other formats, so you should be OK. You can get it from my FTP mirror site in the US. It is    wuarchive.wustl.edu my stuff is located in the    mirrors/architec directory. Please FTP the README file first.  --  Paul D Bourke                       School of Architecture, Property, Planning pdbourke@ccu1.auckland.ac.nz        The University of Auckland Ph:   +64 -9 373 7999 x7367         Private Bag 92019 Fax:  +64 -9 373 7410               Auckland, New Zealand --  Paul D Bourke                       School of Architecture, Property, Planning pdbourke@ccu1.auckland.ac.nz        The University of Auckland Ph:   +64 -9 373 7999 x7367         Private Bag 92019 Fax:  +64 -9 373 7410               Auckland, New Zealand
