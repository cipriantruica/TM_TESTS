And why are we in Somalia?   When right across the Gulf of Aden are   some of the wealthiest Arab nations on the planet?  Why does the    US always become the point man for this stuff?   I do not mind us   helping out; but what invariably happens is that everybody expects   us to do most of the work and take most of the risks, even when these   events are occuring in other people is back yards, and they have the   resources to deal with them quite well, thank you.  I mean, it is    not like either Serbia, or Somalia represent some overwhelming   military force that their neighbors cannot handle.  Nor are the    logistics a big deal -- it is a lot bigger logistical challenge    to get troops and supplies from New York to Somalia, than from    Saudi Arabia; harder to go from Texas to Serbia, than Turkey or    Austria to Serbia.   ---peter
