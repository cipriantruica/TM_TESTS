Hi Janet,  Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance, same onset symptoms,  same cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the people I know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches, that I generally do not bother sharing what i have learned about mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.  I do not think it is heat, per se (i have had more in winter than summer). Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before playing rather than after.  Being in shape does not seem to help me much, either.  i have identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in  descending order of importance):  1) Heavy exercise 2) Sleep deprivation 3) Fasting\t\t(e.g., skipped breakfast) 4) Physical trauma\t(e.g., head bonk)  Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I  do not get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of  the other factors *must* be present (usually    Since I discovered  this, i have been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two  or three years when I get cocky ( it is been so long, maybe I just do not  get them anymore ) and stop being careful.  Hope this is helpful.  John.
