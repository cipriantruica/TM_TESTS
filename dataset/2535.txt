However, when invoking // the window object, the calling program gives up the control to the window // object, and keeps executing the next statement. The source code may look // like the following:  class MyWindow : public TWindow { \t... };  void MyCallingProg(...)  // Could the calling program be a C function? {\t... \tMyWindow *MyWinObj; \tMyWinObj = new MyWindow(...); \tGetApplication()->MakeWindow(MyWinObj); \tMyWinObj->Show(SW_SHOWNORMAL);  \tnext statement;  // I want the program to wait here until MyWinObj is closed \t...              // so that I can get some data back from MyWinObj.  \t...              // I specified the window style to be WS_POPUPWINDOW, did not \t...              // help. Is there any other way to execute the window object \t...              // so that the calling program will not give up the control? }                   // Any help would be appreciated.
