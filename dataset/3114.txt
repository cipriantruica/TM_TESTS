Windows: The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are \t significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card.  VGA:\t The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked \t at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card.  About \t 1/2 the speed, as I recall.  \t The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card.  Each of the  \t P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA.  Orchid \t is the only one I know about (I do not know about AMI) that uses \t the W5286 for VGA.  That is reportedly faster. \t  \t I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as \t the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor. \t (Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)  Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look like?  Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?  --Bob
