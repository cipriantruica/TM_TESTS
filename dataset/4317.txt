I [stuff deleted] : -David -- Even better than that...  how does a 68000-based Amiga 2000 perform in  daily tasks compared to my 68030-based IIci.  Answer, except in a very few cases, I get my butt kicked by the Amiga. Sure there are other considerations, but it goes to show you how proper design from the beginning (in hardware and software) can give you great returns.  [as well as showing you that if you do not have a  marketing department to speak of, no one will care how good your system is]  i am still happy with my ci, but I do not understand why the performance is so bad (comparatively).  They could have done multi-tasking _properly_. They could have done everthing else better -- but apple did not. (of course DOS 6 and windows 3.1 are nothin to write home about either!!)  Oh well, you all got $2.00 worth for the price of $0.02  ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=   Peter Pundy    Email: 2545500@jeff-lab.queensu.ca     i have got no witty wisdom to share, but have a nice day anyway.  ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=
