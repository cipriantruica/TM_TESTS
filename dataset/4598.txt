I have not heard of any problems.  Sounds to me like your dealer does not know what he has talking about.  it is pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the Centris 610 on the basis of problems with one machine.  Recommending the IIvx over the LCIII does not make a lot of sense either.  If this person is so convinced the 610 is buggy have they talked to Apple about it or are they just assuming it is a problem with all of them? -Terry
