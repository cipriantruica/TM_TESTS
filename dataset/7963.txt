From: robert@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Robert Kennedy) Subject: Solar battery chargers -- any good?  i have seen solar battery boosters, and they seem to come without any guarantee. On the other hand, i have heard that some people use them with success, although I have yet to communicate directly with such a person. Have you tried one? What was your experience? How did you use it (occasional charging, long-term leave-it-for-weeks, etc.)?  \t-- Robert Kennedy  Robert Kennedy\t\t\t\t\t(415) 723-4532 (office) robert@cs.stanford.edu\t\t\t\t(415) 322-7367 (home voice) Computer Science Dept., Stanford University\t(415) 322-7329 (home tty)
