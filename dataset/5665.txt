From: mek@hydrox.enet.dec.com (Mark Klamerus) Subject: EventHandlers on XmPushButtons   \tHelp,  \ti have got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across \tthe top (a toolbar).  I wanted to add eventhandlers to these \tpushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that \tI can put up some descriptive text about the function of each \tpushbutton as the pointer crosses over it.  \ti have done this fine, but i have turned up the following problem:  \tWhen the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of \tthe above events, but when they are not sensitive I only get \tcallbacks on LeaveWindow events.  This seems odd.  I would \texpect this to be an all-or-nothing type of thing.  \tIs this a bug?  If not, can someone explain this behavior?  \tthanks,  \tMark
