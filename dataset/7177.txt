From:  Arun G. Jayakumar   Subject: VASCAR  I know this is the wrong place to post this, but I could not find any relevant newsgroups in my area.  For those of you who are from PA, where is VASCAR (where the cops measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance between two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used?  i am especially interested in the Pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior experiences, if possible).  For those PA and non-PA, if they use VASCAR in your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc.  What i am interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk of being caught.  You can always detect radar, but there is no way to fight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are.  Thanks a lot,      Arun Jayakumar
