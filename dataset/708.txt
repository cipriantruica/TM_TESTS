I have never said that only humans are the only beings which are sufficiently sentient to have intentions.   In fact, I have explicitly said that I am perfectly happy to consider that some animals *are* capable of forming intentions.  What I am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive behaviour to have moral significance, since, it seems to me,  such behaviour does *not* involve intention.  |>  |> >>I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative,  |> >>this does not prevent his behavior from being moral. |> >i am sure you do think this, if you say so.

The point is whether the implementor thinks *at all*.    The issue is not whether thinking produces opinion A or opinion B, but whether thinking takes place, period.  |>  |> >i have offered, four times, I think, to accept your definition if |> >you allow me to ascribe moral significence to the orbital motion |> >of the planets. |>  |> Hmm... perhaps you can ascribe it.

Or perhaps you are going to throw in a definition of  natural  that will allow us to describe some actions as  natural  and some as   not natural .   If so, what is the definition?   |> Other than those death which surround mating rituals, other animals  |> just do not kill each other (within a species) that often, do they?    Sure they do, as multiple posters have show you.   Sharks, for example, eat wounded sharks.   i have personally seen cats eat their newborn.  Are you in some kind of denial?   People give you example after example, and you go off the air for a week, and then pop up claiming that it  never happened.    it is very strange.  |> But why do not animals kill each other?  See what I mean.   Here we go again.   What do we have to do: write up a tailor-made FAQ just for Mr Schneider?  jon.
