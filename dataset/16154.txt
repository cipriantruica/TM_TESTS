With one exception, that is a pretty good description of many of the Baptists I know.  The exception is that they know the difference between an M-16 and an AR-15.  Heck - they even know that  it looks like Richard Petty is stock car  does not mean  it is a racing stock car .  They may be uncouth, but they have figured out that appearance is not function.  -andy --
