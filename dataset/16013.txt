Explosion, I note.  The entire compound would have been leveled, not merely burned.  As there was no explosion, there was no CS ignition causing the fire.  \tNote: at five miles a decent grain elevator explosion will knock you on your butt and your ears will ring for days.  I speak from experience here.
