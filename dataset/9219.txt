Alright, that is enough. i have suffered with all kinds of insults (as typical for the net), but give me a break. Galarraga is currently batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he is not drawing enough walks.  What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000? You can hardly claim that he is  hurting his team .  If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen), *THEN* I would agree with you that he is not taking enough pitches. My comment that  he is not paid to walk  does not mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it is more along the lines of: he has batting .400 and leading the league in RBI is so what bloody difference does it make if he is not drawing  a lot of walks? Sheesh.  --Greg
