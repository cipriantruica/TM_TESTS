Good for mid-size older bikes. Rated to 130mph. Wearing well and handles my 12 mile ride(twisties) to work well on the SR500. Costs a bit  more than the Chengs/IRC is etc, but still less than the Sport Metzlers for the newer bikes. Cost from Chaparral is about $60 for the front, and $70 for the rear. --            Jon M.(Mike) Corcoran     \t\t  \'78 Yamaha SR500 - \'72 Honda XL250 - \'70 Husky 400 Cross
