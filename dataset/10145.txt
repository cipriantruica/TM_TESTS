Pros arrive late, nervousness for  rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things  hard to get it going against these  worse  nations.  i had guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better  it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.   Some other reasons why the  worse  teams are so tough to beat was presented  by Hans  Virus  Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).   1) The  worse  teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)     have now usually world class goalies.   2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much     less unnecessary penalties.   3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them  run out of gas.    4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.  >  The only convincing winner was...

Alex, I would like to see the Czech roster, including, if possible, >the clubs from which the players come.

I do not know the teams for all players, so I would appreciate if  you guys could fill in the blanks for me (especially I think some  of these players play in Finland).
