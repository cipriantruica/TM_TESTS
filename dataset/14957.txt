He was never ever a musician in the band.  He was in St. Louis several months back.  The poster I saw at the Christian bookstore I frequent really turned me off.  It was addressed to all  Homosexuals, prostitutes, drug addicts, alcoholics, and headbangers...  or something like that.  Well, if I showed up with my long hair and black leather jacket I would have felt a little pre-judged.  As a Orthodox Christian, and a  headbanger  I was slightly insulted at being lumped together with drug addicts and alcoholics.  Oh yes, I suppose since I drink a good German beer now and then that makes me an alcoholic.  NOT!   -- Steven C.
