I do not think that it is  obvious  that  lots  of people are willing to pay the price.  i am sure someone out there in net-land has some facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity sold.  But even if the trends are relatively flat, you have to consider what is happening on a team-by-team basis.  When the TV money dries up, franchises will be seeking to supplant the lost revenues from alternative sources.  One of the best sources may be ticket sales.  Example 1:\tThe Dodgers  \tThe Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales \tand *probably* believe that they have the ability to raise \tprices without hindering revenues.  I certainly think that is \ttrue.  Example 2:\tThe Padres  \tThey will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year. \tIf they raise prices, less.  If they want to increase their \toverall revenue base, the best thing they can do is put a \twinning team on the field.  But given that will not happen (it \twill not), they can probably make more money by lowering ticket \tprices and running frequent promotions.  Will they do that? \tI have no idea.  But they will not increase prices, because it \twill not work *for them*.   >2) even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners >   decrease ticket prices, that does not decrease the tv contract.   The only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place. Each team is market is somewhat different, and each owner is going to be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those market forces.  As a buiness manager, I would never *want* to lower my prices, but sometimes that strategy is necessary, and sometimes it works. You have to consider everything if you want continued success.     --\tThe Beastmaster  --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com
