I have a MAG 17S (this is a .25 dpi version and it using : a TRINITON tube) and a NANAO 560i in mind.  Good luck finding an MX17S.  When I was looking around back in December/January, Mag was not producing any because they could not get tubes from Sony.  I asked when they expected to restart production as I was willing to wait a few months to get an MX17S but they said not any time soon.  I wound up getting a T560i and am extremely happy with it.
