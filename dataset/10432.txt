From: allan@cs.UAlberta.CA (Allan Sullivan) Subject: Don Cherry - Coach is Corner summary - April 21, 1993     Here is a summary of Don Cherry is Coach is Corner from April 21, 1993. The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.  (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)  Topics ------  Don is Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.  Episode Summary ---------------  This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don is tie. Don was pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn, and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)  Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night is games, because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter and Fuhr.  Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the  greatest goalie , and said that he has winning the series against Boston all by himself. He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when Fuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised  do not Trade Fuhr!   Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would be Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the trade, but Don feels Muckler is been vindicated.  The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver game, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty. Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved, but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don:  Its sad what they are doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.   Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto. People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke  Wendy  for not fighting. However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.  This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking:  it is like college hockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody. that is why you are seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you will not drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made by people who do not know what is going on in hockey .  The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip of Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was taught to  play to win , which differs from today is idea of just letting kids have fun.  At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach is corner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like one of the chipmunks.  Rating ------ Typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some good quotes.  i had give it a 7.0 out of 10.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------                           |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)                           |Department of Computing Science,          _______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.                     _   |---------------------------------------------------         ___ ___    (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the  credit...           - U. of A.
