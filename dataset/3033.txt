From: rsrodger@wam.umd.edu (Yamanari) Subject: Turbomodem+ (Complete Pc) question   \ti am trying to transfer some software between two machines  \tand i am having real trouble.  My own Intel 14.4k ( \tv32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it \tat 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem, \tat the other machine, is a  Turbomodem+  from  The  \tComplete PC  (the machines are in seperate houses,  \tso a direct serial link is impossible, and copying this \tmuch data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines \ton for a few hours and go see a movie--no, this is not \tpirated software).  \tI am having no end of trouble trying to set it up.  It will \tdial and connect just fine--at 9600 baud.  But if I try to \tset the comm at 19k2, 38.4k or 56kbps, the stupid thing \tconnects, but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k).   \tHis machine (a dx48633) has a 16550AFN UART, so that is \tnot the problem.  \tIt seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to \t \ta comm program _at_ 14.400bps, even though it will take \tdialing instructions at 56k (and respond OK, etc. to  \tother commands).  I do not have a comm program that can \tdo precisely 14.4k.    \tI looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is, \tI did not have this trouble with the Intel--it came \tready to connect this way.  Do I need to initialize it \tany way in particular?  \tAlso, it is _using_ V.42bis and V.42 (and MNP5) when connecting \there (i.e., at 9600, since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far) \tbut it does not _say_ so there.  any ideas?  \t(BTW:  I tried the initialization string that I use for \tmy modem, but it just gives ERROR on that one)   --  MOSCOW: A grandfather who taught literature in an orphanage has gone on trial in Rostov-on-the-Don after confessing to more than 50 gruesome sexual murders whose victims included children as young as eight. \t-- Events in modern history, from the Sunday Mail, 19-Apr-92
