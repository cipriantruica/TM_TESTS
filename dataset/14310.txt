From: bell@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (E. V. Bell, II - NSSDC/HSTX/GSFC/NASA - (301)513-1663) Subject: Displaying compressed Voyager images on a Mac   \tSorry, i have lost track of who asked the question originally  \t(our news server at GSFC keeps things around for tremendously \tshort periods of time), but wanted to be certain before I \treplied. Someone asked about displaying the compressed images \tfrom the Voyager imaging CD-ROMs on a Mac. As Peter Ford (MIT) \tpointed out, a decompression program is available via FTP. \t(Sorry, I do not remember the name of the node offhand,  \talthough it is .mit.edu.) In any case, though, one of the MAC \tdisplay programs (CD ROM Browser by Dana Swift) does display \tthe compressed images directly. The program is shareware and \tis distributed by NSSDC for nominal reproduction costs ($9 + \tshipping, if memory serves). This does *not* cover the \tshareware price which should go to Dana for his diligent work \tand upgrades, however.  \tTo request current pricing information, information about \tavailable display software, catalogs, or data from NSSDC, \tcontact our user support office at:  \t\tNational Space Science Data Center \t\tCoordinated Request and User Support Office (CRUSO) \t\tMail Code 633 \t\tNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center \t\tGreenbelt, MD   20771 \t\tPhone: (301) 286-6695 \t\tFax:   (301) 286-4952  +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |  Dr. Edwin V.
