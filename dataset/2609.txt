From: 55526@brahms.udel.edu (Oliver P Weatherbee) Subject: New Windows drivers for Cirrus GD5426 graphic cards!   I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426  chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu  (file is 5426dr13.zip). they are very recent, I downloaded them from the  Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there,  email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.   I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).  I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus is part but I do not think so.  From Steve Gibson is (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons  (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the  following for the sake of comparison:  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tWintach              \t\tWinbn3.11\tWord\tSprsht\tCad\tPaint\tOverall Steve is system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro\t  9.33\t\t10.34\t 20.78\t8.28\t14.90\t 13.58  my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster\t\t  9.88\t\t 8.65\t 11.71\t18.84\t15.40\t 13.65   Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of  the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson is review.  Micron system owner is, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the  DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120  drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s,  I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I cannot get a Norton is sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at  least that was what the program said.   Oliver Weatherbee oliver@earthview
