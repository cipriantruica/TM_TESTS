In the event of a total hard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data from the backups I keep of that.  With upwards of 100Mb of stuff on my hard disk, there is no way i am going to try and back it all up without a tape drive. :)  Would be nice to have one though!  > RAM is something you add all the time, so no.  it is more like BIOS > manufacturer and/or processor type (386/486/etc).

Today it does not happen as often (I would hope), but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS information is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the motherboard.  This type of upgrade does not require a hard disk backup/restore.  > On the other hand, to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as >  Please Insert Original Disk   as I need file YYYYYY for update .  :-)  > It would be perfectly reasonable...  Sort of.  \tAs long as it was not done too terribly often.

Your scheme is not going to stop anyone.   > Of course it is easier.  Are you saying then the originals SHOULD allow > only one install?  What is your point?  \tOf course not.  If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be reinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is  this software has already been registered to  and it is against the law to install it on other machines.   Or something similar; Access for Windows does this and it only requires a click on  OK  to go away.  Pretty non-intrusive, but it gets the point across.  > What I said was the program should have certain restriction (such as the > restrict-to-one-machine) UNTIL the program is registered with the > manufacturer.

I like the key system that some shareware products use.  The only problem is that it will be difficult for big software companies to implement this without it getting very cost-ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users.  -- Steve Madsen sjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu  Ask me about Linux, the free 386 unix!
