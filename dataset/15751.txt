From: jim.wray@yob.sccsi.com (Jim Wray) Subject: sign of the times...   Article in this morning is Houston Post.... negotiators send food to rebellious inmates as humanitarian gesture ...speaking about the Ohio prison riot where they have killed at least one of the hostage guards.  I know it is not the same  group  but the mindset appears to be common to  those what rule  here lately....they will not give diddley to the BD is in Waco but they treat criminals as deserving of  humanitarian gestures .  This is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy more priviliges in today is society than their victims or other law abiding citizens. What is it that makes the criminal so precious to the  leaders of the system ?  Could it be that the criminal is one of the  tools  the  authorities  are using to  excuse  some of the rights negation they are trying to foist upon the law abiding citizen in the name of crime control....do not solve the crime problem because then the citizen could not be held hostage to  our help .  If the crime problem were solved in favor of the citizen/victim at the expense of the criminal none of the crap such as RICO and gun banning could be used as excuses to work the agenda of those who would control our every move and thought. ---  .
