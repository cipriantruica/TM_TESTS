My problem is that i am new to the field and paragraphs like the above keep popping up.  i am sure what Mr.  Bellovin is writing about is both fascinating and important, but I have  NO IDEA what it means.  :-)         Anyway i am keen to learn and will read anything I can get my hands on that explains this stuff in lay terms (I have a decent CS background, but not a huge amount of hyper-advanced math).  Can anyone point me to a FAQ or a decent source of information about the guts of current cryptography and maybe a little history as well?  I read the piece in this month is WIRED, can anyone tell me how much I should trust the references they suggest?    Thanks in advance,    Steve.  --              Steve Kramarsky, University of Chicago Law School            steve@faerie.chi.il.us -or- smk5@quads.uchicago.edu        All I did was kiss a girl.  - Jake, the night before his hanging.
