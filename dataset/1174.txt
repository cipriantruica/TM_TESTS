You need to give  more info if you want to get any answers! :P  I do not want texture mapped, cause if I did i had asked for them. :)  Just a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons.  As for the processor, it had be for a minimum of a 286... maybe 386 if I cannot find a good one for 286s. Ideally, I want a polyn function that can clip to a user-defined viewport, and write to an arbitrary location in memory.  Of course the chances of finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess i had need the source with it.  Oh, and I guess it would need to be in ASM otherwise it had be too slow.  i have seen some polygon routines in C, and they have all been waaay too slow.  Its for a 3D vector graphics program.  i have been hunting high and low for a polyn function in ASM, and I cannot find one anywhere that I can use. i have found one or two polyn functions, but my ASM is pretty bad, so I will not even try to rewrite them. :) \t\t//Lucas.
