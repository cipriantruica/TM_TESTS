I meant to comment on this at the time.  there is just no way baserunning could be that important - if it was, runs created would not be nearly as accurate as it is.    Runs Created is usually about 90-95% accurate on a team level, and there is a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the remaining percent.  Greg
