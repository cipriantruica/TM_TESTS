From: Eric.Cronin@f174.n2240.z1.fidonet.org (Eric Cronin) Subject: PhoneNet questions  My school is settin\xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbdg up a new network with bothe Macs and Apple II is.  i am used to ethernet, and do not know mu\xef\xbf\xbdch about LocalTalk.  Two things:  first, in MacWherehouse, bthe\xef\xbf\xbdy have PowerUser network connectors, and the caption leads you to bel\xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbdieve that you can plug them into the phone lines in the building and have them work.  Is this true?  i have seen it done by running sep\xef\xbf\xbderate phone cords, but never with real lines.  Second, if that does work, could you use a modem \xef\xbf\xbdhooked up to that same line while the network was active?  Help would be greatly appriciated.  BTW-\xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbdrunning seperate phone line  is out of the question, the network wil  VERRY spread o.
