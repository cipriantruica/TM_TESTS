Just go into the Printers section of your Control Panel.  Select the printer you want to re-direct to a file, and click on Connect.  Then choose :FILE as the port to connect the printer to.  When you print from any application to that printer, Windows will prompt you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the printout.  it is pretty easy.  Good luck!    -.---.          -.---.          .--------------------------------------.  |---\'           |---\'        . |              Perry Reed              |  | .=..-..-.. .  | `. .=..=..-| |    perry_reed@hp0000.desk.hp.com     |  \' `- \'  \'  `-|  \'   ``- `- `-` |Be young, be foolish, be lucky in love|              -\'                 \'--------------------------------------\'
