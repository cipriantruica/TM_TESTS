And another has    already fired off a letter of protest to NIST.     My point? I suspect this list, interesting as it is for various    reasons, does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together.    Some of them, yes. Others, no.   I received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on the list, and does not know why he was added.  i am sure the same applies to others on the list.  So, I guess my initial theory was right, that the clipper list was just someone is idea of a bad joke.  I guess I should be happy it was not a conspiracy.  \t\tMarc -- Marc Horowitz N1NZU \t\t\t\t617-253-7788
