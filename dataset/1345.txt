From: oehler@yar.cs.wisc.edu (Wonko the Sane) Subject: 48-bit graphics...   \tI was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! :-) ) and he made a reference to a 48-bit graphics computer/image processing system.  I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or something akin to that.  Anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel.  that is 60 bits of info--what could that possibly be for?  Specifically the 48-bit color?  that is 280 trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve.  Is this an anti-aliasing thing?  Or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.  \tAlso, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are SGI is flagship products?  I know of Iris, Indigo, and Crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line? (sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)
