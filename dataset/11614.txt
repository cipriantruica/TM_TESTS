In that case, anyone  : who is trying to hide behind anther encryption scheme will stand out : from all of the other traffic and raise a red flag to the NSA, etc.  I think the obvious answer (which may have been posted, but I have not seen it) is to encrypt your data with some other scheme, then run it through clipper.  The only way the police will be able to detect the other encryption is through a wiretap, so even if they do notice with an illegal wiretap, I have a hard time seeing a judge issuing a warrant for a search to  confiscate  the illegal scheme (assuming that at one day, it comes to this; a worse case) based on an illegal wiretap.  Then again, maybe I am an idealist.  :>  : \t------------    --------    ---------------------- : \tBen Liberman    INTERNET    ben@genesis.MCS.COM : \t                            ben@tai.chi.il.us  -- Michael Sawyer - My opinions are mine, not necessarily UH is, NSF is, or NASA is University of Hawaii Physical Oceanography/Satellite Remote Sensing RIPEM public key available, MD5OfPublicKey: C53C8744A87664168D135C0763DCCC1D
