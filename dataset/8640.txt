From: thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank) Subject: Players Overpaid?  there is a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.  I thought i had put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  I splurged and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, like Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of $1 million for the lot of them.  The total team salary is  $7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.  If that is too steep, you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one of the best teams in the majors.  p, Juan Guzman, 500 p, Mussina,\t400 p, Castillo,    250 p, Eldred,      175 p, Rhodes,\t155 p, Militello,   118 rp, Rojas,\t300 rp, Beck,\t250 rp, Melendez,   235 rp, Hernandez,\t185 rp, Nied,\t150 c, Rodriguez,\t275 c, Piazza,      126 1b, Thomas,\t900 1b, Bagwell,    655 2b, Knoblauch,\t500 2b, Barberie,\t190 3b, Gomez,\t312.5 3b, Palmer,\t250 ss, Listach,\t350 ss, Pena,\t170 lf, Gonzalez,\t525 cf, Lankford,\t290 rf, R.Sanders,\t275 of, Plantier,\t245 --  ted frank                 |  However Teel should have mentioned that though  thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |  his advice is legally sound, if you follow it  the u of c law school     |  you will probably wind up in jail.  standard disclaimers      |                    -- James Donald, in misc.legal
