From: ronaldm@extro.ucc.su.OZ.AU (Ron Mastus) Subject: Problem with Adaptec 1542B SCSI and Jumbo Tape Drive   Hi,      i have just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B, and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive.      I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI drive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backups from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 mins actual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE drive.      I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to  enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I cannot find any mention of it in the manuals.   My system config is:    i486DX/33 4Mb     Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI    IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE    Jumbo 250 running off floppy controller on IDE    Any help would be appreciated      Thanks,     Ron.
