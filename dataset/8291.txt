From: mpmena@skcla.monsanto.com Subject: DoD Pins...NOT!  Hi there kids and kidlets...   It your ol\' pal the KotPM  (Keeper of the Pin Money!)   i have got good new and bad news...  \tGood news - I got laid..er... \tThe pins will be coming, to use the computer software phrase,   real \tsoon now   \tBad news - Right after we placed our order, the company upped its \tminimum order for manufacturing.  We got in under the wire (with \tan order of 115 or so pins), but as a result of the low number of \tpins, we were relegated to the  we will get to it in-between other \truns  bin.  As a result, it seems that it may be another 4 or 5 weeks \tuntil your beloved Geeky is guiding you along the blacktop..  (And \twe thought madonnas on the dashboard were foolish; hmmm, now, if that \twere Madonna sitting on my dashboard, that could be DANGEROUS...hell. \ti am tough.)     SO...please continue to be patient.  As soon as they arrive, i shall post    \tthe grand announcement, and rush our Messiah on his way directly \tto your abode.  In the meantime, if you need revised versions of the \tholy word of Geeky, please send $15.95 cash or money order (no COD is) \tto:  \tRanch Apocalyp...er......Ashram Geeky, 305 Cyberspace Place...  \ti am off to MSF class...hope it is not too BORING...my wife made me go \twith her!  \tMichael Menard
