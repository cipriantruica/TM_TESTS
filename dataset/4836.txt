What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I > get round the problem!!  Does the workstation you are using have hardware cursor support?  Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there is screen activity, it is probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you are probably battling a bug in HP is X server.  i am not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  it is quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just  that.  In reality you are probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns.  -joel
