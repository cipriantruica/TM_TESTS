From: sanjay@kin.lap.upenn.edu (Sanjay Sinha) Subject: Battery Charger   I just noticed that my halogen table lamp runs off 12 Volts. The big thinngy that plugs into the wall says 12 Volts DC,  20mA  The question is: Can I trickle charge the battery on my CB650 with it?  I do not know the rating of the battery, but it is a factory intalled one.    Thanks, Sanjay  --     \'81 CB650 \t\t\t\t\t\tDoD    \t   I would give my right arm to be ambidextrous!
