From: rryan@panix.com (Rob Ryan) Subject: Efficient PC Clients  we are looking at various X11 clients for PC is and we are looking for some information about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any notably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now i am looking at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP platform, and it is (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the Sparc10 is console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for PC (presumably Windows) clients?  Also, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be  *much* slower even with V.42bis.)  i am in the process of installing PPP (with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  i have seen a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but are there comparable products out there?  If we are looking for efficiency for async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard PPP w/ compression and XRemote?  Any information would be greatly appreciated.  i am still taking in all the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency of various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)  Thanks.  -- Rob --  Rob Ryan, System Constructs Inc.     rryan@panix.com
