When I was referring to  you dorks at the Western Business School , I was specifically referring to those assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of Minnesota for no apparent reason.  Being Canadian, and one who has friends who attended UWO, I personally do not want to be associated with the idiots who wrote those messages.  One more thing, Andrew...until this season, the Leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen years (have they won the Cup during our lifetime?)...so the North Stars have not been the only  shit  team in the Norris.  -KEA
