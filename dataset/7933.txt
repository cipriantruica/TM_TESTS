That torque, and an upright riding position is better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm low torque motor.  To a cruiser-motorcyclist, chrome has some importance. To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice.  Unless motivated solely by price, these are the criteria each rider uses to select the vehicle of choice.   To ignore these, as well as other criteria, would be insensitive. In other words, no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser rider may have.(sometimes it is hard for *any* motorcycle to fufill a person is requirements)    you are fishing for flames, Dave.  This difference of opinion is analogous to the difference between Sports-car owners, and luxury-car owners.   This is a moot conversation.   --  => Dan DeClerck                        | EMAIL: declrckd@rtsg.mot.com      Motorola Cellular APD               |                                   Friends do not let friends wear neon | Phone: (708) 632-4596            <= ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
