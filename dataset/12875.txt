Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe, to treat  capillary fragility , and seemingly in even more extreme cases-- a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he had had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously, I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical sputtering.  I have no idea how he has doing hemorrhoid-wise these days. The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.  This stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there is little risk of trying it, but I would not expect much of a result.  --  Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer
