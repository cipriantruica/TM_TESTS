From: shou@logos.asd.sgi.com (Tom Shou) Subject: Ford Explorer 4WD - do I need performance axle?  we are considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with 4WD and we have the following questions (All we would do is go skiing -- no off-roading):  1. With 4WD, do we need the  performance axle  - (limited slip axle). Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tires are on different terrain.   2. Do we need the all-terrain tires (P235/75X15) or will the all-season (P225/70X15) be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe?   Thanks,   Tom  --    ===========================================================================          Tom Shou\t\t\tSilicon Graphics \tshou@asd.sgi.com\t\t2011 N.
