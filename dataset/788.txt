Is this is a fair premise?         I utterly BR> reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of    BR>      truth.  It is better than the crap that the creationists put out.  So far all they have been able to manage is distortions and half-truths. (When they are not taking quotes out of context...)  BR>         Some of these so-called human-like creatures were BR> apes.  Some were         humans.  Some were fancifully BR> reconstructed from fragments.   The genetic code has shown more about how man is realted to primates that the fossil record.  (A little detail the creationists try and ignore.)  BR>            Good deeds do not justify a person in God is BR> sight.            An atonement (Jesus) is needed to atone BR> for sin.  Who says?  Your Bible(tm)?\tI would be surprised if *ANY* Christian followed all of the rules in the Bible.  (Most of them just pick and choose, according to the local biases.)  BR>      My point: God is the creator.  Look is like we agree.  Where is your proof?  How do you know it was *YOUR* God?  BR>      i shall send you some info via e-mail. BR>      Regards, Bill.  Why not post them?\tI would be interested in seeing them myself.                     Alan
