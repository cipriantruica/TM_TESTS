From: main lambda.msfc.nasa.gov (John Main) Subject: xod - does it exist?   Hello,  I was wondering if anyone knew of an interface to od ( octal dump ), I assume it would be called xod.  Actually, any viewer for a core file will do.  I looked at export (   mit ) in the index of /contrib, but did not find anything  relevant.   \t\t\tThanks, \t\t\tI Hate bama & winter \t\t\tmain superman.msfc.nasa.gov
