My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?  \tYeah.  I do not use the clutch all the time either.  i have done it with Fords, BMW, Datsun, and Chevy and it works fine.  I cannot think of any reason that it would damage the tranny.  Essentially you are just doing what the synchros do anyhow - match the engine speed with the tranny speed and slip it into gear.   >On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so >worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. >To date i have driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy.

I usually slip it out during throttle-down and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right (usually about a second) and then slip it into gear...  >krispy --  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Jon  You obviously do not know who you are dealing with  Gross jong@halcyon.com --------------------------------------------------------------------
