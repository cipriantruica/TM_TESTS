My gripe about TIFF is that it is far too complicated and nearly infinitely easier to write than to read, which I think hurts your acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g., paint programs).  In a nutshell, I do not think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is trimmed significantly- and then it would not be TIFF anymore.  They keep trying to cut it back, but it is late now.  Maybe they >will< fix it, and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility.  That would probably make me happy.  ab
