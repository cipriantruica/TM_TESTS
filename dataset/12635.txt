From: bmdelane@quads.uchicago.edu (brian manning delaney) Subject: Brain Tumor Treatment (thanks)  There were a few people who responded to my request for info on treatment for astrocytomas through email, whom I could not thank directly because of mail-bouncing probs (Sean, Debra, and Sharon).  So I thought i had publicly thank everyone.  Thanks!   (i am sure glad I accidentally hit  rn  instead of  rm  when I was trying to delete a file last September.  Hmmm... \'News?\' what is this? ....)  -Brian
