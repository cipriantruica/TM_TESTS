From: rab31910@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Alex Bratton) Subject: Quicktime resolution?  Anyone happen to know what the max resolution for quicktime is?  i am  trying to determine if a maxed out system using quicktime could produce and edit broadcast quality video (including bringing the video in via video spigot/etc.).  So far I have yet to see anything that is even close to S-VHS in quicktime, but it had be great to hear that it is possible.  Thanks for the help, Alex Bratton
