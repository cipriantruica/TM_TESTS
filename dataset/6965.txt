Because Greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their RADAR collision-prevention system. They use RADAR to monitor how close other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are, and signals a warning to the driver if they are coming up on something too fast or are getting too close.  This is all I remember from the news reports a few months back; at the time, they were only talking about the possibility of installing the system. (They did not mention how it worked in bumper-to-bumper traffic, or how it discriminated between a Camaro approaching at 120mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached  at 60mph on a curve.)  I do recall something about progressive stages of warnings, from flashing lights to audible warnings--ie, it goes from a red  Too close  light to hysterically screaming  WE\'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!   :-)  \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
