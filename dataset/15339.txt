Note the difference here. One is saying, if *Christ* disagrees with  a Christian being gay, *Christ* can change that.  The other is saying, if *I* think being gay is wrong, that a Christian cannot be gay, *I* need to tell them to change.   As Lois said, and as before her Paul wrote to the believers in Rome, WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE ANOTHER\'S SERVANT?  -jen  --       //  jenk@microsoft.com  // msdos testing
