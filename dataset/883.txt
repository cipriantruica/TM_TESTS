Look in Computer Shopper. : They are available fairly cheap. They allow switching between two : serial devices on a single port.  Unfortunately the poster wants to use an internal and an external modem so a switch is not going to help them.  If you are not using your com ports for anything else, just define them on different com ports.  Define your internal modem to be say, com1, and your external modem to be com3.  You really should not have to worry about interrupt conflicts since you will not be using both modems at the same time :).  --- Christopher Chan-Nui    | Investment in reliability will increase until it channui@austin.ibm.com  | exceeds the probable cost of errors, or until someone    | insists on getting some useful work done.
