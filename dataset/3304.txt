From: brw@yobbo.tusc.oz.au (Brian Wallis) Subject: DFI Handy Scanner, How to talk to it?  I have a DFI Handy Scanner Model HS-3000Plus and a little bit of software running under dos to use it. i had like to make more extensive use of this device (in particular, write a driver for it on unix).  So, can anyone give me a description of how to talk to this device. It connects to the system via it is own interface card.  Any info would help, it cannot be too difficult to talk to :-)  thanks, brian wallis... TUSC Computer Systems Pty. Ltd.
