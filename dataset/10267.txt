From: tmenner@sei.cmu.edu (Thomas Menner) Subject: Hockey Equip. Recommendations?  Hey man! -  Having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a couple of sessions of mock hockey, i am ready to invest in hockey equipment (particularly since I will be taking summer \'hockey lessons\').  However, I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it comes to hockey equipment.  i have checked out local stores and looked at catalogs, but I was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before actually plunking down any money.  Having played football in high school and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for comparison.  But for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to different kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles?  Are there any notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles?  etc.  So any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.
