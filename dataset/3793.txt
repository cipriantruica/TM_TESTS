From: glenn@network.ucsd.edu (Glenn Sueyoshi) Subject: LaserWriter Pro 600 memory upgrade (4-->8)  i have got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memory upgrade.  I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi at Apple Customer Assistance.  She tells me that those who purchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, no greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers who are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  For those who do not know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi  or greyscale (at 300dpi).  If the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their hardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance  1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).  Regards,  Glenn  P.S. - personally, i am annoyed at our school bookstore.  They really have an obligation to provide this information to all of the customers who purchased the 600 in the original  configuration (they have the records...that is why they ask for things like a phone number).  When I get my upgrade completed,  i am going to write Apple and complain.
