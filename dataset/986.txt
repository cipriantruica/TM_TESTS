But unfortunately I was looking for the same graphics feature described in this book but _NOT_ in 640x480x16 or 320x200x256 mode. It is easy to accomodate all the pixel  descriptor  (or color attributes) in those modes into A0000-AFFFFF, but not in 640x480x256(which is what I am interested in).  I have not finish the book but I affraid the author did not talk much about this mode(or other SVGA modes).  If anyone out there know any good book dealing with fast SVGA graphics manupulation(scrolling, repainting, all other good stuff..) please send me mail.  Programming guide to SVGA card is also welcome.  \tThanks in advance.     ************************************************************************ *                         Tiang   T.
