Yeah, right. Real muscle cars had a manual transmission, and their clutches are not that heavy. Shelby-American used plenty of high-powered, high-torque engines, and Carroll only put autos in his cars because people wanted them. (Blasphemers! Heretics! Burn them, burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto! ;-) Real Cobras (and they were the ultimate sports car at the time) had big-block Fords which turned out prodigious amounts of power and torque, and _none_ of them had automatics.   >And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.  Yeah, if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve  fun.  :-)  I personally would _love_ to have a \'66 Galaxie 500 7-Liter Coupe, with a fire-breathing 427 and four-onna-floor (to go along side my \'66 Galaxie 500 pillarless hardtop with a fire-breathing 390 with three-onna-tree; I love the sound of dual exhaust in the morning! :-). there is no comparison between a REAL American Muscle Car and a car with a big engine and an automatic, IMHO.   \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
