From: daniels@NeoSoft.com (Brad Daniels) Subject: Fresco status?  i have been hearing rumblings about Fresco, and it sounds like it may be what i am looking for, but how far is it from release, or at least some kind of availability?  How similar is it to InterViews?  If I code to InterViews, will my code work with Fresco?  How about Motif?  i have heard some mention of versions of InterViews which support Motif.  Will it be feasible to use Motif with Fresco?  Any information would be much appreciated.  - Brad --  Brad Daniels\t\t`\t|   If money cannot buy happiness, daniels@neosoft.com\t\t|   I guess i shall have to rent it.
