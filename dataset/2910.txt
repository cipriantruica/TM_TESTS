Maybe so, but then why did I pay >\textra for the large capacity tape drive?  \tYou got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me, believing \tthat the  250  logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity. \tThe people who do this sort of thing for a living call it  \t marketing.

Does this sound about right?  \tThis is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do  \tthe same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape  \tis grinding away the whole time means that your block size for  \tthe write is too small.  Is there any way to change the block  \tsize or write buffer size so it is bigger?  >    o\tDuring the backup, about a dozen files came up with  access >\tdenied  errors.

Anyone else had this happen?  \tThis is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the  \tTAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration \tfile for the tape system.  I would recommend running the backup \tfrom DOS so it will make a complete backup of the TAPE directory.  >Thanks for any and all feedback on this system.  i had also appreciate >hearing of good sources for blank tape cartridges, preferably 250 Mb >size.  \tThe 250mb cartridges will not do you any good since the drive \twill not write 250mb of physical data on the tape.    >Thanks. >-pd  --  -brent williams (brentw@netcom.com) san jose, california
