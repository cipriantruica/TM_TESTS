From: Rob Earhart  Subject: Re: Mix GL with X (Xlib,Xt,mwm)    Yes, it is possible... in fact, there is some gl widget code in /usr/lpp/GL somewhere... (it is named Glib.c; my IBM is down right now though, so I cannot find the exact location :)    WARNING: this code feels quite bogus. It does things like calling noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an X window id from it anyway. It worked just fine under aix 3.1; I spent last weekend trying to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 does not seem to like it), and it is turning into a Hard Job.    Check out your  info  pages; it has some pretty good documentation on whan you can and cannot do when mixing gl and X, and how to go about doing so.    )Rob
