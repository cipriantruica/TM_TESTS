From: Wayne Alan Martin  Subject: Re: Help with ultra-long timing  Sounds like a job for a universal time reciever.  I do not know the logisitics of the situation, but if you could just place a reciever in snow and place the oscillator in a nice lab somewhere else, your problems should be solved. Just a suggestion.  Wayne Martin
