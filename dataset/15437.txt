Read that one sentence in there... to the degree \tthat means other than the death penalty and military operations are \tsufficient to keep the peace, then these non-violent provisions are to \tbe preferred...   \tI do not believe that it is necessary for us to murder criminals to keep \tthe peace; the Church in the United States feels the same way, thus the \treason that the Catholic Church has opposed every execution in this \tcountry in recent memory.  >As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church is teaching on capital >punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total >accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly >force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.    \tSo what is justifiable?  As you stated very explicitly from the new \tCatechism, the only justifiable case is when it is necessary to keep \tthe peace.  Since that does not apply *at all* to this country, the \tlogical conclusion (based on your own premises) is that one must be \topposed to *any* form of capital punishment in America.   \t\tJust my opinions. \t\t\t\tMike Walker \t\t\t\tUniv. of Illinois
