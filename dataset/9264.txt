But i had like to differ with your opinion about  a city which is likely to pour in the votes... .  I attended many games last year during the balloting.  I know that a great number of the attendees DID NOT fill out their ballots, but left them, beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands.  Toronto gets no more and no less votes than any other city for the All Star game.  Unfortunately, this is not a one time thing.  i have attended games during the last four seasons, and it has happened every time.  The apathetic attitude to All Star ballots really offends me.  Ljs
