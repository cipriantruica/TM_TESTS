Eminent domain is a state-mandated transaction in which one party is required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party, regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all, at a price which is set by the state.  I fail to see how this doctrine can be found in tort, bankruptcy or contract cases in general.  Well, okay, sort of in bankruptcy...  *  *  *  *  *  >> If so, so what?

You believe that the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should consider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute. _Boomer v.  Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party, Boomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party, the Atlantic Cement Company.  The facts supported Boomer is contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his property, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop doing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court.  > Bill, if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation > requiring multi-million dollar cement plants to be shut down because > of a smattering of cement dust, at a cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1, > you had be up in arms.

Quite the contrary, i had probably support the action, since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in _Boomer_: the idea that people is property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer is property rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the hypothetical EPA ruling you have presented, it is the American people is collective property rights in a healthy physical environment.  What good is cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 if you wind up with cement dust in your air?  *  *  *  *  *  >>> Your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant. >>> If the State of Massachusetts came up with a similar regulation, >>> you had be up in arms and complaining about interference with >>> property rights, and Fifth Amendment violations.

Yes.  So what?  The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society.  If society can have its cement plant without violating anyone is rights, fine.  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant.

Which  one  are you speaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people is rights. Besides, Coase is Theorem only has real application in the never-never land of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people are going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise  irrational  from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so.  I do not care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head, so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150 per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain do not want any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.  *   *   *   *   *  >> And then you say:  Everyone is property rights were protected; the >> plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were >> avoided.

Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth Amendment.  As to your  Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made whole, because the award of damages in involuntary  claim, you are at least partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer).  In these cases, the  sale  has already taken place and is irreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and (b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented from happening at all) by order of the court.  In these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the potential victim is property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the parties themselves.  >> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the >> business of ensuring that  unnecessary  settlement costs are avoided? >> (If so, i have been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were >> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.) > > Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.  In cases like _Boomer_, they are simply a cost of doing business.  The fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose property rights they would be violating via the operation of their plant. there is nothing punitive or unjust about it.  >> (2) It is  completely sensible  only if you believe that the alleged >> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid >> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and >> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to >> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who >> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement is wrongful acts. >> [wdstarr] > > Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire > set of possessions to wronged person?  were not you complaining about > excess punitive damages before?  Anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be required to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance.  And the seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege.  No injustice, no punitive damages.  *   *   *   *   *  >>> you had like Posner, Bill.  he has a libertarian. >> >>Really?

Atlantic Cement wanted to be able to _continue_ to violate Boomer is rights.  While the court may have been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already committed, it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the _future_ violations of Boomer is rights and to then force Boomer to sell at that price.  -- William December Starr
