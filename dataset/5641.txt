I think there is a program in the Berkeley distributions called mkdep that will do essentially this. -- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Vivek Khera, Gradual Student/Systems Guy  Department of Computer Science Internet:   khera@cs.duke.edu             Box 90129             (MIME mail accepted)          Durham, NC 27708-0129 (919)660-6528
