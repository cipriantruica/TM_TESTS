From: smb@research.att.com (Steven Bellovin) Subject: More technical details  Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman is note, courtesy of Dorothy Denning.  Again, this is reposted with permission.  Two requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit key.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such that neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be implemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and another generates the second.  *That* is ominous.  Second -- these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they carefully-crafted spook postings.  do not attempt to draw out hidden meanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of Clipper). Leave Denning out of this; given Hellman is record of opposition to DES, which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I do not think you can impugn his integrity.  Oh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper are not stupid.  If you think something does not make sense, it is almost certainly because you do not understand their goals.  \t\t--Steve Bellovin  -----  Date: Sun, 18 Apr 93 07:56:39 EDT From: denning@cs.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning) Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip To: (a long list of folks)  I was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to Marty is message:          The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in   The algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16 in DES.  \tIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his  \tor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key  \tplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be   K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method (e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the AT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key is negotiated using a public-key protocol.   \tencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK,  \tand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part  \tmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK  \tproducing  \t     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the  family key ) and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I will also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.          The unit key  \twill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1  \tand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow   The unit key, also called the  chip key,  is generated from the serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys. Compute the 64-bit block           R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]   (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3. (i am unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that they are called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.  \tauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be  \tdecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that  \tthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they  \tmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased.   Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions. Please pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty is criteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions i have received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia, LANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.  \tWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law  \tenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information  \tflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that  \tthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a  \tcourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links  \tover which a message will flow.]   My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it will be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through the decode box, which will have been keyed with K.  \tfor  the wiretap authorizations.  When Levy asked for \tthe details so he could review the cases as required by \tlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned \tover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not         comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear:          No single person or authority should have the power to         authorize wiretaps  No single person does, at least for FBI taps.  After completing a mound of paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain that includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the Attorney General for final approval.
