J The Habs dominated this game and especially in O.T..  You realize that we dominated game 1 also and should be ahead in this  series 2 - 1?  J Glorieux were plagued by bad luck; the puck would not bounce their J way.  But in O.T. they got their lucky break, the winning goal J went off Gusarov is skate.  Thank you Lord!!!!!!  And it is about time! We hit 2 posts in this overtime and 1 post in  game 1 is overtime. let us hope that **we** start getting some luck for  a change.  He played well in this game but Roy is inconsistency still makes me  nervous. Otherwise, i had say we are going to win this series, no sweat.  it is all up to Patrick Roy to provide **consistent** goaltending.  J And those damn Bruins lost in O.T., their down 3-0.  Congratulations J Buffalo!! J  J Life does not get better than this!!!!!!!!!
