(missing late season or was it world >series games because of Yom Kippur)  The other Jewish HOF\'er is Rod Carew (who converted).    Lowenstein is Jewish, as well as Montana is only representative to the major leagues.  Undeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish.  Between Stone, Koufax, Ken Holtzman (? might have the wrong pitcher, i am thinking of the one who threw a no-hitter in both the AL and NL), and Big Ed Reulbach, that is quite a starting rotation.  Moe Berg can catch.  Harry Steinfeldt, the 3b in the Tinkers-Evers-Chance infield.  Is Stanky Jewish?  Or is that just a  Dave Cohen  kinda misinterpretation? Whatever, does not look like he stuck around the majors too long. --  ted frank                 |  thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |         i am sorry, the card says  Moops.  the u of c law school     |  standard disclaimers      |
