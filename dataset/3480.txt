From: idler@cs.tu-berlin.de (Andreas Kuehnel) Subject: Delayed-Write-Caches  i am using Norton Cache 5.0, which is really nice but horrible incompatible. Some games will not work it, my streamer software will not work with it and Windows does not like it at all. But when copying or deleting lots of small files, only NCACHE is really fast. You see, to write a file the FAT must be changed. But to write 1000 files the FAT must be changed only once. Is there any cache program out there which is smart enough to do the same and good enough to run with all my applications? Any help is really appreciated.
