He will also stand up to someone after he hits them, not like >that pussy Oaf.  Exactly my point.  If you had watch games more closely, you had see a lot  of goons going after him.  Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical  players for Pgh are left alone.  Ulf plays rough hockey, but only when  other players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr.  If you want to say anyone on the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it is Jennings or Caufield.  do notslander a good defenseman because your favorite players cannot beat the Pens even when they take dives (like Gartner) to try for the cheap penalties.  >As for his slash of Lemieux, fine.

After all, he did get a suspension for it...  Hey, that is fine!  If a player does something stupid, he should be penalized including Ulf.  Or Mario (you are not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter.  it is pointless to say any one person is a cheap-shot goon,     because you shall see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then, especially if you aresomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is.  >-JPC  >--  >------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >John P.
