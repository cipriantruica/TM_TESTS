Look, guy, I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving, but if he has been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to lighten up? I mean, it is not like most of us have not had a few and then ridden or driven home. *We* just did not get caught. And I can speak for myself and say it will *never* happen again, but that is beside the point.  In answer to the original poster: i had insure whatever vehicle is cheapest, and can get you to and from work, and suffer through it for a few years, til your rates drop.  And *do not* drink and drive. I had one friend killed by a  drunk, and I was rear ended by one, totaling my bike (bent frame), and only failing to kill me because I had an eye on my mirror while I waited at the stoplight.
