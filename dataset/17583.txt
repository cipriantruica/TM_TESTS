Probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation i have posted.    Teel, it is bad enough you post this bs, it is even worse that you do not    even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces, but then posting    that no one is looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the    contrary point to a severely deluded mind.  What I found interesting about Conklin is letter is the  6 cases he has won against the IRS.  Now, assuming that these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?) they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  The IRS fought one of his deductions.   Defending your deductions seems puny when you believe that there is no need to file in the first place!  -- \t\t\t\tBernard Silver \t\t\t\tGTE Laboratories \t\t\t\tbsilver@gte.com \t\t\t\t(617) 466-2663
