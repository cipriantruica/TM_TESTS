My local Honda dealer says that my 1969 Honda Dream 175 >was commonly referred to as a  serious touring bike  when it first >came out?!?!?!  (maybe there IS something in the water around here).   what is the problem here?  Back in 1958 I rode a Puch 175 from Paris to Barcelona and back.  That was a two stroke, and back then it was representative of the size of bikes on the road.  A 350 was considered a big bike, and the superbikes of the day were 500cc or 600cc.  Anything bigger was real rare.   Charlie Smith,  DoD    doh    1KSPT=22.85  \tNothing in the water! \tMais, voulez vous un peu du melange ?
