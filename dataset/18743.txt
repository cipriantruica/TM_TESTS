I will tell you another secret.  I get this burning sensation in my hand every time I hold it over a candle.  The pain does not fill my entire body, and i am told the longer I hold it here, the less it shall hurt (it shall eventually burn up the nerves, or so i am told).  So I suppose I should just ignore the pain, because holding my hand over the candle is something I just want to do. i have got the right, do not I?  Your body feels pain to let you know something is wrong.  it is your body is alarm system informing you that something needs your attention.  A fever tells you that you are sick, and need some sort of care.  Guilt can be seen as that  emotional or spiritual  alarm, just informing you that there is something that you have done that  requires your attention .  It does not require a  personality type  to become a believer.  It requires someone who is willing to listen to themselves, their body & soul.    = All I know is that I do not know everything. And frankly speaking = I do not care, life is fun anyway. I recognize that i am not  = perfect, but that does not hinder me from have a healthy = and inspiring life.  For several years all I knew is I really liked dropping \'cid (LSD). Frankly speaking, I did not really care.  It was fun anyway.  It did not matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a  *tremendously* greater risk of serious birth defects.  For several years all I knew is I really liked having sex with as many women as I could convice.  Frankly speaking, I did not care.    I did not care that I was putting each one of them at risk (as well as their future partners).  It did not matter that for the first decade of my marriage, my wife and I will have the worry that possibly that last sneeze meant something *much* worse than a cold.  =  = There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice = thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden, = the shoulders feel far more relaxed!  The nice thing about pain killers, if you take enough, you will not care about  the fever, shortness of breath or pain.  --  Jason D.
