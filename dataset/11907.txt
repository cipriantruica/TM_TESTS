From: cs000rdw@selway.umt.edu (Richard D Warner) Subject: UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystem  \tThis is a followup post to something i have written previously.  Several people responded with good information, but I do not think I communicated  exactly what I am looking for. \ti am working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  it is been done so much, that it  would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program.  Well, there is one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS). Everything i have seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  that is too much for this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART built-in, so you are only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a  company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain  circuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.  Rich
