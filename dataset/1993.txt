Special thanks to Brian Evans of Georgia Tech   for all the help.    --> FTP       COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp\' from  mishna.esys.cwru.edu (Internet No. 129.22.40.23). A sample ftp session  is given at the end of this file.  **********************************************************************  --> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)  \tIn this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of  the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.   Since Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working  LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than  Mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK  smaller. Thus Brian Evans\' Signal Processing packages that supported  the LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the  COSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For  power users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very   fine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at  the anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP   130.207.226.24).  On   the  downside, the disadvantage of this update  can be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its  previous version.    ***********************************************************************\t --> For Mathematica 2.0 users \t \tWe have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in   the directory `For_2.0\'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into   the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory.   ************************************************************************** \t     --> Introduction         This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems  analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using  Mathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some   modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package.           This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a  NeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been  used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control  engineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for  undergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I\' taught at the Systems  Engineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have  also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and,  IBM PC is (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested  to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on  platforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to  evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.      Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of   Mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the  packages are many notebooks ( COSY_Notes ) which demonstrate   the functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of  many fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books  listed in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have  been collected from the various references given at the end of this  file. The contents of the notebooks in the  COSY_Notes  directory are  given below.      ----------- Begin  COSY_Notes  Contents -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 01_Introduction.ma  CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Control Systems \t \tSections:   \t     Analyticity \t     Poles and Zeros \t     Signals \t     Forward Laplace Transforms \t     Inverse Laplace Transforms \t     Differential Equation With Zero-Valued Initial Conditions \t     Differential Equation With Initial Conditions \t     \t       -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 02_Math_Models.ma  CHAPTER 2: Mathematical Modeling of Dynamic Systems   \t Sections:   \t      ODE to State Space   \t      Linearization of a Nonlinear System of Equations   \t      State Space to Transfer Function \t\t       -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_*_Transient_Response.ma  CHAPTER 3: Transient-Response Analysis               (Chapter split into three sub notebooks because of file \t     size)  \t NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_1_Transient_Response.ma              \t    Sections :        \t      Time Response Analysis   \t      First order System   \t      Second Order System   \t      Third Order and Higher Order Systems \t                NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_2_Transient_Response.ma              \t    Sections  :        \t       \t      First Order System (Step Response vs. Time Const)   \t       \t                NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_3_Transient_Response.ma              \t    Sections  : \t      Second Order System (Step Response vs. Damping Ratio)   \t       \t              -----------   NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 04_Steady_State_Response.ma  CHAPTER 4: Steady-State Response            Sections:\t       \t      Routh is Stability   \t      Steady-State Error Analysis                   ----------- \t\t  NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 05_Root_Locus.ma  CHAPTER 5: Root-Locus Analysis   -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 06_Freq_Response.ma  CHAPTER 6: Frequency-Response Analysis           Sections: \t      Bode Plot Analysis   \t      Magnitude vs. Phase Plot (Nichols Plot) \t      Polar Plot   \t      Nyquist Plot   \t      Combined Example \t        -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 07_State_Space.ma  CHAPTER 7: State Space Methods           Sections: \t      Introduction \t      State Transition Matrix \t      Controllability \t      Observability \t      Output Controllability \t      Pole Placement Design  \t      Observer Design \t      Time Response Using State Space Methods     ----------- End Notebook Contents -----------    --> Compressed Files          The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9 packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:   COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     \t\tcompressed tar file for Unix systems \t  COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     \tcompressed sit file for Macintosh   \t\t\t\tsystems and encoded by BinHex 4.0  \t\t\t\tformat (requires the   shareware \t\t\t\t Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher).  \t  COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip    \tzip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS           Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on  Macintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also.   --> Installation of COSY_PAK   o In UNIX Command line type the following command:        zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf -   o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware     Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.     o In IBM Command line type the following command:        pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip  NOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. You must use  pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  IBM PC is may limit the  directory name characters to eight. In that event type  pkunzip -o -d  COSY_PAK.zip.  You can also unzip the COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip file on any  Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it.        Uncompressing and untarring  COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z  or unzipping   COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip  will create a directory called  COSY_PAK .          \t Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory   COSY_PAK  containing the following three files, four  sub-directories and their contents:  SUB-DIRECTORIES in  COSY_PAK :     COSYPAK    - contains control tool box packages    MANUAL     - COSY_PAK manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats.
