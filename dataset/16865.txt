My point is that they have   made a few pro-forma, perfunctory remarks, and sent in a few C-130 is and   so forth, but it is clearly not something they are losing much sleep over.   they are just going through the motions, while Moslems are being  ethnically   cleansed  out of what used to be Yugoslavia.   The US has been speaking   out far more loudly than the Moslem nations in the UN and other world   forums.   >>  Besides, there is no case that can be made for US military involvement >>  there that does not apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or >>  (it appears with the Khmer Rouge is new campaign) Cambodia.

Humanitarian concerns were not the primary justification   for US involvement in the Gulf - oil and geopolitics were.  If the    the Kuwaitis did not have oil (and assuming Iraq still saw fit to    invade them) I doubt you would have seen Operation Desert Storm.   ---peter
