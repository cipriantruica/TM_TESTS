Yes, I have both Arts & Letters and CorelDraw.  I personally like Arts & Letters better but there are things I like about Arts & Letters that CorelDraw does not do an vice-versa.  I have not found the perfect graphics program that does everything yet.    My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different formats.  Arts & Letters does not.  I like the thousands of clipart available with Arts & Letters.  However, I do find looking them up in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying.  One of my major problems is that there is not any programs available on the market for the artistically deprived :-).    / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / Betty Harvey       | David Taylor Model Basin ADP, Networking and Communication Assessment | Carderock Division      Branch                                  | Naval Surface Warfare Code 1221                                    |   Center Bethesda, Md.  20084-5000                    | DTMB,CD,NSWC                                                 |    (301)227-3379   FAX (301)227-3343            |           / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /  / /
