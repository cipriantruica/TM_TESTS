Without knowing more it is not possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring, or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there are no dietary limitations in patients with Crohn is except as they relate to obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on  recurrence of Crohn is.  It is important to distinguish recurrence from recurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as  recurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the intestine.    Your friend should look into membership in the Crohn is and Colitis  Foundation of America.   1-800-932-2423  Good luck to your friend.  Steve Holland
