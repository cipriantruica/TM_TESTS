It would be interesting for Apple to come out with a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU is 680x0, like RocketShare. But I  guess that is getting a bit fantastic!  I was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were  iseeded\' with PowerPCs on a NuBus card.  Also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? Last I heard, the  estimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. I heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines at a much earlier date that Q1 94, but I doubt it is true.  Finally, is the PowerPC developer is CD \'mini-course\' available? I saw it  advertised in the developer is university calendar, and i had like to know if it is at all *interesting*.
