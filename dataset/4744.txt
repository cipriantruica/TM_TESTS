From: mmc@cs.rit.edu (Mahendra M Chheda) Subject: How can I rotate text ?  Hi,  I am programming in XView, SunOS 4.1.2 & OpenWindows 3.0. I would like to rotate some text and display it. I did read the FAQ in comp.windows.x but am not sure how do I translate it to XView. I would appreciate if someone can give me tips on how to do it. Thanx.  \t- Mahendra.  PS : As I am not a frequent news group reader, I would appreciate if      answers/replies would be mailed to me. I will post a follow-up.  --   *************************************************************************** \tMahendra Chheda\t\t\t  \tmmc@cs.rit.edu\t\t\t  \tmmc7274@ritvax.isc.rit.edu\t  \t\t\t\t\t  \tOffice :\t\t\t \tResidence : \tDept. of Computer Science\t \t440 Kimball Drive \tRochester Institute of Tech.\t \tRochester, NY 14623 \tTel. 716-475-2079\t\t \tTel. 716-292-5726 ***************************************************************************
