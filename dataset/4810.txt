From: hsteve@carina.unm.edu () Subject: XTranslateCoord. Problem  It seems like XTranslateCoord. does not work the way I expecting it.  Right after performs a XMoveWindow, I want to know the absolute window position with respect to the root window.  To get this info. I do a XTranslateCoordinates but the abs_x, and abs_y are not right?  Does anybody know of a way to find  out this information?  Thanks, please e-mail to hsteve@carina.unm.edu if it is possible  --      _---_     Steve      / o o      hsteve@hydra.unm.edu, hsteve@carina.unm.edu   |  ___/ |                  Just say NO to VMS!!
