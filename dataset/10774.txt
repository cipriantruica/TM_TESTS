From: deuelpm@craft.camp.clarkson.edu (Hobbit) Subject: Re: White House Public Encryption Management Fact Sheet   I have a question about digital communications encryption:  \tThe Fact Sheet mentioned encryption/decryption microcircuitry with  special  keys  for law enforcement for wire tapping purposes.  \tIf I wanted to, could not I develop  encryption of my own?  That is, if me and a partner in crime had unique Encryption/decryption devices installed before the  tappable  one, could not we circumvent the  keys  system?  Or replace it?  \ti had be really interested in knowing how the E/D microcircuits might be made to prevent such befuddlement! (Laymans\' Language, please! maybe a bit technical...)  Please E-mail to me, as i am not in Net News as much as i had like to be!
