From: Tony_Sullivan@mcontent.apana.org.au Subject: Re: DeskWriter Drivers 3.1 -- How to install ?  Can someone tell me which of the files that come with DW-3.1 go where and for what purpose?  What can be left out, for instance, if you do not want to do background printing?  As far as I can remember, all you need to do to get your Deskwriter up and printing using the 3.1 driver is to drag the driver itself (either serial or appletalk depending on your needs) to the system folder. You do not need the fonts or anything else if all you want is straight forward, bare bones, basic printing....I do not have anything else installed and can still print on a Deskwriter using sys7.1 and HP driver 3.1 Tony ***************************************************************************  The views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only.
