If a landlord sells an apartment building  vacant  to another landlord and fails to notify his tenants, they just might find themselves out on the street all of a sudden.  The seller may be a scoundrel and a crook but this does not make the buyer a  thief , as Israelis are so often called here on tpm.  >>It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the >>palestinians were shafted.

The Arabs that lived along the coast in Western Palestine, later to be called Israel, were shafted by their brother Arabs just as they have been shafted for decades since then by their Arab bretheren.
