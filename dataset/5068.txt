Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm do not do it. They place the title at that position and the window at a position below it.  This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current configuration and restore is later.  Currently, my solution is:  \tXCreateWindow(...); \tXSetWMProperties(..); \tXMapWindow(...); \tXFlush(...); \tXMoveWindow(...);   It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering if i am overlooking something obvious.  Richard.
