And I do not think ANY guilty verdicts should have been returned. i am sure you know why they handed down guilty verdicts on two of the officers. it is quite simple really, it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities think it is right to riot. I hate to say this, but I would have liked to see them riot with everyone prepared. It would be open season if your skin was even slightly brown.  Hey, my motto is, you do not fuck with me or my stuff and you do not get killed. it is just that simple.  Tony  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Anthony S.
