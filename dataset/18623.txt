Me: [ happily picking daisies by the side of the road ] BC: [ dancing on the double yellow broken line ]      Come on out and play on the highway!  Me:  Why?  BC:  The highway was put here for people to be on.  We must work towards      fulfilling its purpose.  Me:  But --  BC:  Look, the highway has been here for several generations.  Look, I      have a story about how it was actually created by a divine being!      And several people actually saw Elvis bless it!  Me:  But --  BC:  Look, are you going to come out here, or not?  Me:  But --  BC:  You probably think that picking daisies is fun.  Well, you are wrong.  Me:  Where in blazes did you get this silly idea that you are supposed to      be playing on the highway?  you shall get yourself killed!  BC:  Better to be killed on the highway than to live an empty life off      of it.  Besides, you are just asking pointless questions.  You know      you really want to be playing on the highway too; you are just      denying it.  Me:  If you want to get run over, then fine, but i had much rather enjoy      the daisies, if you please.  BC:  Why do you shun me like this?  The Creator of the Highway will flatten      you with a steamroller if you do not see the light and come join me!  Me:  Well, if he has gonna be THAT way about it, maybe I want to get as      far from the highway as I can...  BC: [ incoherent but quite familiar righteous sputtering ]  Brian C., do not you see?  I do not believe that your god is:  \t(a) real, or even  \t(b) beneficial.  In fact, I believe your religion is imaginary and, carried to extremes, harmful.  I would like to help you see its shortcomings, and perhaps someday finally become strong enough to see it for what it is: an elaborate lie, kept alive by the elite priesthood to keep the masses properly submissive to their influences.  Please offer me an argument that is more convincing than  you just do not believe \'cos you do not want to.   Everything you have said so far could apply equally to any religion -- why do you believe yours is the real one?  (Note that saying  it is the only one that promises eternal life  or something like that is not an answer to my question, unless you show that (a) no other religion promises eternal life and (b) it is unarguably true that eternal life must be a reality.)  --  _/_/_/  Brian Kendig                             Je ne suis fait comme aucun /_/_/  bskendig@netcom.com                de ceux que j\'ai vus; j\'ose croire _/_/                            n\'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent.   /  The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre.  /    is that it ends.                                           -- Rousseau
