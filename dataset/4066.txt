From: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Dan Keldsen) Subject: sony 1304 & Rasterops 24sx(si) for SALE! - UPDATE!!  Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...   If you are at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu   i am compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces, i am just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one screen.   i had prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you do not live near here. Only problem is that I did not keep the original boxes for the monitors, but i am confident that my few months of full-time service in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and flip it in your direction.   Details:   Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card: ---------------------------------------------------   **SOLD**   Sony 1304 14  color monitor: ---------------------------- what is to say? It got top ratings in last year is MacUser report. it is a SONY, Trinitron, arguably the best (but i had rather not argue that point). it is a great monitor, in great shape, but i am going to a bigger screen, and although i had like to keep it, finances do not justify it.   Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.     RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM): ------------------------------------------------------------------ Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13  monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode (you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg SIMMS).   Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), i am asking **$525** (shipping included this time, it is just a card). Original box and packaging. i had actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a  bundled offer  for these items.   ------------   Cheers.   dan keldsen - djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu  --  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  a.
