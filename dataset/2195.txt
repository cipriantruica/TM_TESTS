I think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the SIGNIFICANT amount of disk access that Windows does on startup.  it is like it is trying to it is bit in wearing the damn drive out.  I estimate it is only reading a Mb of programs & data, but from the performance the drive gives, it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive (my drive is however regularily compressed).  What is it that takes so much fuss.  Perhaps if MS  would take the trouble to optimize this startup process, less people would  be wanting to find a solution themselves.
