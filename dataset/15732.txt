Not provable.  it is about as  provable  as the number of votes vast for Bill Clinton in the last election.  If you accept the information available, you can prove one way or the other.  If you refuse to accept it, nothing is  provable.   >I think that that >there are actually *few* cases where this is so.         Fine, support your assertation.  But, you have not supported any assertations just yet.        The National Crime Survey, that secret Arm of the NRA, estimates between 40,000 and 50,000 with-gun self-defenses from assaults, and is considered to considerably under-report.  When broken down by weapon, there is no form of  self-defense  including dowing nothing which is more effective at avoiding injury or death.  >The bulk of firarems are used against unworthy and unnesessary >opponents ...  those who posessa a cool jakcet you want, those who >would argue with you about a parking space, those who would >take your woman. In short, trivial and worthless causes.        Ok, support *this* assertation.  Hell, support *one*.  >Too much of this has ruined you cause. There is no recovery.         that is nice.  >In the near future, federal martials will come for your arms.        that is nice, too.  >The 2nd amendment is dead. Accept this. Find another way.         Why on Earth should we?  If you are correct we have nothing to lose by continuing to argue against it and everything to gain.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.
