Until homosexuals stop trying >to impose their morals on me, I will be in your face about this.  Gosh, I have to associate with heterosexuals against my will every day!  That means you have imposed your moral codes on me, now does not it?  Fortunately, I have taken the time to get to know some members of the het community and discovered that, hey!  They really AREN\'T all evil elitists with no concept of reality!  i have got a few clues for you.  (a) i am not working to pass any laws.  (b) Our morals are YOUR morals: I imagine you value freedom.  So do we.  If you value your own freedom, you must necessarily accept that these laws are important to protect it.  After all, discriminate in one area and you are open to discriminate in the rest.  (c) I suggest learning a bit more about gays, lesbians, and bis before you post the kind of drivel you have been.  it is obvious that you have not a clue who you are talking about.  >--  >Clayton E.
