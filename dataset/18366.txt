More along the lines of Hebrews 12:25-29, I reckon...  \tSee that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they \tescaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much  \tmore shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that  \tspeaks from heaven:  \tWhose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, \tsaying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also \theaven.  \tAnd this word, Yet once more, signifies the removing of \tthose things that are shaken, as of things that are made, \tthat those things which cannot be shaken may remain.  \tWherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved,  \tlet us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably  \twith reverence and godly fear:  \tFor our God is a consuming fire.   Or 2nd Thessalonians 1:7-10...  \tAnd to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord \tJesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,  \tIn flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, \tand that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:  \tWho shall be punished with everlasting destruction from  \tthe presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;  \tWhen he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be \tadmired in all them that believe (because our testimony  \tamong you was believed) in that day.    Kinda gives Flaming a whole new meaning, I reckon.   \t\t\t      -  -  The impression I got from talking with Livingston was that the coming of the Lord, power-wise, is going to be something that those who are unprepared cannot handle -- kinda like overloading a fuse -- due to  guilt. Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as  we know it. LF suggests that God does not want that and has sent Koresh  as a reminder.   Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those protected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive. And no -- I do not  have a good idea yet what  being shielded by the seals  actually involves  or how exactly it relates to salvation. (Other than it involves the marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride... for those of you Biblical well versed.) \t\t\t     -  -  Me personally, i am totally 100% dependent on God through Christ, so  if God wants me to understand, good. If not, also good. If God wants to save me, or dispose of me, that is great either way. Being born in the Spirit, means being part of the Body of Christ (Ephesians 2), so who and what I was, matters little. * what is important is loving GOD *  Come Nova, Nuke, or Apocalypse -- who cares? Satan might even be able  to pull off a pretty convincing fake. Big deal. Not worth fearing or  worrying about though, not before:   \t\t   -* The Greater Glory of GOD *-  \t  Maybe Koresh is right, maybe he is not, and it should be interesting to  see the new message (or prophecy). The tour of the Bible i have taken in  studying the passages he points to in the 3-02 text, has been most re- warding. But the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears -- which  is not yet clear.   Much much more important is  Charity  -- which by definition *is* --  \t                   Love for GOD  (I hope Dear Reader, you have taken all this as an expression of faith,   and not a statement of mere fact. Seems many folks get real upset at   reminders. ;-)     | -- J --     |    | stephen
