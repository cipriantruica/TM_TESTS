I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here...)  Basic Scenario:  \tI set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of \tfiles on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users  \tconnect they send a private key encrypted using the system public \tkey and the user is public-private keypair is used to wrap the \tone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The \tresult of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it \tis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the \tmachine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed \tsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personal \tprivate keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:  \tDoes the fact that the system private key does not provide any \tinformation useful for a search give me any protection as far as \tbeing coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)  \tIt seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am \tassisting in  entrapment  (the users would send thier key anyway \tand are not being enticed into doing something they would not \totherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?  \tWould the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?  Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...  jim --  Jim McCoy                |  UT Unix Sysadmin Tiger Team mccoy@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |     j-mccoy@nwu.edu          |  pgp key available via finger or upon request
