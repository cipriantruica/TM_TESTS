From: dmn@kepler.unh.edu (there is a seeker born every minute.) Subject: flash LEDs with sound?         i am looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response  to the output from a walkman cassette player. How could I do this? I do not want it just to turn on, I want it to  istrobe\' once so to speak, per every beep I put on a cassette tape.        Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette, or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency? Is there any easy way to do either of these? i am looking for  the simplest circuit possible. I guess what i am asking for is some sort of color organ, but not quite. Let me trt to explain again...        i am going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape. So on the tape you had hear:   beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause)..etc.  , with speed increasing as time goes on. I want to synchronize an LED ( probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. So the LED, with each beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sort of effect. The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS. And if there was no sound on the tape (except for background his), the LEDs would remain off. Please help!     Thanks,      Dana
