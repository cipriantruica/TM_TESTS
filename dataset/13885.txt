From: ldaddari@polaris.cv.nrao.edu (Larry D\'Addario) Subject: Re: Russian Email Contacts.  It is usually possible to reach people at IKI (Institute for Space Research) in Moscow by writing to  \tIKIMAIL@esoc1.bitnet  This is a machine at ESA in Darmstadt, Germany; IKI has a dedicated phone line to this machine and someone there logs in regularly to retrieve mail.  In addition, there are several user accounts belonging to Russian scientific institutions on  \t   which is a commercial enterprise based in San Francisco that provides email services to the former USSR.  For example, fian  is the  PHysics Institute of the Academy of Sciences  (initials transliterated from Russian, of course).  These connections cost the Russians real dollars, even for *received* messages, so please do not send anything voluminous or frivilous.  ===================================================================== Larry R.
