First, there is no reasonable evidence linking Masonry to ancient Egypt, or even that it existed prior to the late 14th century (and there is nothing definitive before the 17th).       Second, worship of Osiris is not, nor has it ever been, a part of Masonic practice (we are strictly non-denominational).  >tangents, never ending tangents,       You said it!  >Rex  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeter Trei \t\t\t\t\t\t\tptrei@mitre.org \t\t\t\t\t\t\tEditor: Masonic Digest
