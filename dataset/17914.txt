Perhaps I failed to make myself clear:  Minorities in the U.S. *correlate* with poverty.  This is not good and we should address it, but we shouldnt\' ignore that minorities and poverty *do* tend to go together.        *Does* Vancouver have a consistantly poor population drawn along racial lines?  If it does not, then assumptions of being able to compare minority vs. majority in both cities is questionable at best.  >>... >>>Post hoc ergo propter hoc.

Remember, you cannot just say that >crime increases indicate a failure of the laws to affect crime rates.  You do not >know whether the *rate* of increase would have been different without the >laws.            If the *rate* of increase over a period of several years remains unchanged, or increases, I think it is not a far jump to say that the laws are not effective.  No, you cannot sit down and say that things would not have been worse.  I do not have a crystal ball and neither do you.  However, that road leads us to a place where it is impossible to critique *any* action.  If it gets down to be,  It might have been worse without them,  then there *is* no valid objection, which i am sure would amuse certain people to no end.  >You do not know whether the laws prevented a threefold-increase or  >failed to stop a two-fold increase.           So we have got a situation where we have several options:  \t1)  The crime rate decreased:  Obviously gun control worked.  \t2)  The crime rate remained the same:  It would have been worse \twithout gun control.  \t3)  The crime rate increased:  Perhaps the laws prevented an \teven bigger increase.         Cute testing ground we have got.  All responses support the proposition that gun control works.         The question is this:  Did Washington D.C. experiance an increase in its violent and/or gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern indicated prior to the implemented gun control laws.  If it did, then the suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to  control  did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control laws.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.
