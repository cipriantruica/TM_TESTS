Well, my next helmet will be, subject to it fitting well, an AGV sukhoi. that is just because I like the looks. My current one is a Shoei task5, and it is getting a little old, and I crashed in it once a couple of years ago (no hard impact to head...My hip took care of that.). If price was a consideration i had get a Kiwi k21, I hear they are both good and cheap.  > Christ, I do not treat my HEAD as carefully as I treated the shoei as far as  >tossing it down, and I do not have any bruises on it.   Be *mildly* mildly paranoid about the helmet, but do not get carried away. There are people on the net (like those 2% you mentioned) that do not consistently live on our planet...  Regards, Charles DoD0.001 RZ350 --  Within the span of the last few weeks I have heard elements of separate threads which, in that they have been conjoined in time, struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing gourd. --Unknown net.person
