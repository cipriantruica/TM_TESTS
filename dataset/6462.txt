From: wdempsey@athena.mit.edu (Wayne R Dempsey) Subject: Computer Equipment Garage Sale!!!   Computer Equipment Garage Sale:  i have finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff that is broken or not being used by me.  i have put together a list and indicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I am very open to any offers, including trades.  i am currently looking for some CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy  disks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically  anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor is cat, etc...)   Make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked...  I really want to get rid of this stuff...  Ok, Here is the list:  52 Meg 3.5  SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model    I bought this from a guy \tat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I cannot seem  \tto get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The \tguy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk  \tDoctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (i shall send you a copy)  \tI was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I cannot return it to  \thim. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I do not know how to set)  \tso maybe that is the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it did not \twork so i am trying to minimize my losses.\t~$45  52 Meg 3.5  SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model    Same situation as above. \tI bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different \tmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD \t(I have one for each drive) will be included.\t~$45  40 Meg SONY 3.5  SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model    The drive mechanism  \tis completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and \thad a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the \tcomputer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which \twas not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller \tcard is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a  \tproject.\t~$20  65 Meg Seagate 5.25  HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model    I originally bought \tthis drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that \tI could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine, \tand that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller was not sending \tproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive,  \tlooking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I \taccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the  \tdrive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but i am not that good \tat soldering so I could not do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed \tup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on \tme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications, \tworth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C, \tExcel, and many others)  \tI think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all \tthe software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only  \task that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry \twhen I broke that connection, and then could not fix it.  I just do not  \thave time to play with it any more.\t~$65  AT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know \twhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I \thave some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an \tAT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in   \tworking order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how  \tthis is worth...   Let me know if you are interested.  Motorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I have not tested this one out yet, but if anyone  \tis interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I \thad trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the \tmanufacturer of the board and found out it could not be used without  \tanother controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the \tprices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.\t~$65  CGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  was not working last time I checked (although \tI think I was using a bad monitor)\t~$5  5.25 \t360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work,  \tbecause when I took it out of the PC, it was working!\t\t~$25  5.25  360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to  \twork.  Came out of same PC as above.\t~$25  5.25 \tFloppy Drives.  cannot guarantee that these will work.  I do not \teven know if they are low or high density drives.  I do not have \tany method of testing them. \t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  there is another \t\t\tnumber on it: 2626-361723. \t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  there is also \t\t\tanother number on it: H3649-101457 \t\tToshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one  \t\t\tabove. \tEach Drive ~$10  3.5  PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I cannot test it, but I \tthink it works.  Not sure if it is high density or low density, but I \tsuppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number \tDFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35  MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  i have got three of these, and I have no way \tof testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit \tcard with a floppy controller built in.\t~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for \tthe 16-bit card w/floppy.  Interesting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is, \tstandard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No. \tD1181-80020\t\t~$10    i have sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many  satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they did not need anymore.  I  usually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (have not had any problems yet)  and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.  Well, that is all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you  can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate to throw away stuff...   -Wayne  wdempsey@athena.mit.edu (617)-225-9349
