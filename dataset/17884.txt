I do not remember the article that you removed so I cannot comment on it.    What I can comment on though is your response.     Do you really believe that what you wrote is sufficient to refute    the article?  Do have any facts in addition to your opinion?  No one has time to chase down every rumor that gets printed in the National Enquirer or whatever.  The point is to wait and see if the assertions of the (rather bizarre) original post will be corroborated in any way.  Perhaps they will. The recent posts of the rather bizarre original poster speak for themselves.  -david
