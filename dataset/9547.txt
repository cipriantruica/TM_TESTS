In any case, on Winfield.  Yes, his career BA is a mere .285.  He did not beat this until his sixth year in the majors, and has only topped it once since 1988.  His peak was in the early \'80s, and included some rather impressive seasons.  But then he has also had other scattered great performances (like 1988 and 1992).  Definitely *not* a smooth career curve!  Cheers, -Valentine
