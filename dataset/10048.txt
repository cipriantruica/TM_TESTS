(actually it is not that cheap up hear either... though once you have all the equipement it is not more than $300 a year... actually i haven\' played in about 8 years so i could be off a bit... )  In the states, where ice time is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year... compare  this to baseball and you shall see that hockey is a sport for the well-to-do... And this brings up the fact that the well-to-do in the US are majority white...  BTW: what was the original question... i think it has to do with the Hispanic communtiy and playing hockey....    \t\t\t\t\tCheers! \t\t\t\t\t\ti. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  ingo@sunee.uwaterloo.ca                   | The more violent the body     | |  iwweigel@descartes.uwaterloo.ca           | contact of the sports you     |  |  ingo@electrical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca      | watch, the lower your class.  | |  iwweigele@electrical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca |         -- Paul Fussell       | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If the University of Waterloo had on opinion, this probably would not be it...
