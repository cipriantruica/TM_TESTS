From: silver@fraser.sfu.ca (Craig Silver) Subject: format a:/s under Win. & DOS6 ??  Has anyone experienced problems formatting a system floppy in the File Manager under DOS 6?  I get a formatted disk but when I boot with it, my hard drive is not recognized.  I did install DoubleSpace.  Also, I *was* able to make a good-working system floppy from the DOS 6 command shell (no Windows).  Let me know if you have had this problem too and if you have heard what is going on. --   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Craig Silver\t           Computer Science at Simon Fraser University silver@sfu.ca (Internet)   Burnaby, B.C., Canada
