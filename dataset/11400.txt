From: jim@rand.org (Jim Gillogly) Subject: Re: Clipper considered harmful  Steve Bellovin writes a well-thought-out and nearly persuasive article about why the Clipper (are we still calling it Clipper today, or have they figured out a non-infringing word yet?) protocol is almost as good as one can do given their marching ordes.

In answering this >question, please accept NSA is fundamental assumptions:  that both >strong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap >*some* domestic users, is necessary.  i shall accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument.  In my view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is secret, leading to suspicion that there is a back door.  Without complete disclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled, no matter how many trusted experts are allowed to look at it in isolation.  Is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm?  The only concern i have seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could build Clipperphones without registering the keys.  Assume F can really be kept secret as the Government assumes.  Then as part of the initial connection, a Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate that they both know F.  For example, the initiating phone picks a number Q and sends E[Q; F].  The receiver sends back E[Q+1; F], and the initiator sends back E[Q+2; F] to demonstrate that her first packet was not just a random 64-bit block.  Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so it cannot be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial numbers of subsequent challenges.  This way Clipperphones will talk only to other Clipperphones.  Of course the Pseudo Company can build their own proprietary Skipjack phone, but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that they will not get approval for it without equivalent key escrow.  what is wrong with this picture?  It depends of F staying secret and on Skipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis, but the Government appears to believe in both of these.  Even if the particular Q&A I suggest has some flaw, I imagine there is a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that does not.  smb says: >The third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a good >idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.  Agreed.  My view, and you can quote me: if it is not worth doing, it is not worth doing well. --  \tJim Gillogly \tHevensday, 3 Thrimidge S.R. 1993, 20:48
