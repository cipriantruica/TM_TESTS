From: mcole@miracle.informix.com (Mary Cole) Subject: Seeking All Star game Info   OK, OK, OK. First, my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request, but here goes anyhow:  i am *very* interested in finding out how I might be able to get two tickets for the All Star game in Baltimore this year. My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game. I went with them, and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child, to the All Star game in DC many years ago. Although i am now in the SF Bay Area, i had *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game; it is absolutely the last chance they would ever have to attend this g     ame locally.  Any info would be greatly appreciated!!!!  Mary Cole mcole@informix.com
