They are still accepting submissions from the members for various proposals of how to implement the standard.  You do not seem to realize that while v32bis was just an extension of v32 (which took years to pass, implement, and finally sell at a reasonable price), v.fast requires all new technology (not just faster DSP chips, etc.) to achieve its performance.  Wait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly after that.  --  Bing Ho bing@zinc.cchem.berkeley.edu   University of California at Berkeley
