Ya know, the Second Amendment says  \tA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a \tfree State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, \tshall not be infringed.  Now, notice, it says *arms*.  Not guns.  Arms.  The Comsymp ZOG wants you to think that it is the only legitimate possessor of nuclear weapons.  Unconstitutional!  You and I have just as much right to a kilogram or two of nice weapons grade plutonium as any cruddy little pointy headed liberal Los Alamos pinkos.  Support your right to keep and bear short range nuclear weapons.  it is a legitimate and challenging sport.  And screw the limit.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tspl --  Steve Lamont, SciViGuy -- (619) 534-7968 -- spl@szechuan.ucsd.edu San Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource/UC San Diego/La Jolla, CA 92093-0608  My other car is a car, too.                   - Bumper strip seen on I-805
