I think it is; i have heard it is not.  Lets >say 8 bit samples.  Would *raw* data at the corresponding sampling rate >be usable?  If not, how fancy does the compression need to be?  Reasonably fancy.  Standard  voice  circuits run at 56kbps inter-exchange in the US. Therefore, you need to achieve 4:1 to get standard voice quality.  If you are willing to give up some quality, you need only 2:1.  This is still acceptable from a speech standpoint; it will be a little less faithful to the original, but certainly intelligable.  that is all you really need for this application.  -- Karl Denninger (karl@genesis.MCS.COM) \t| You can never please everyone except Data Line: [+1 312 248-0900]\t\t| by bankrupting yourself.          \t   LIVE Internet in Chicago; an MCSNET first!
