This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed laetrile (whether licensed or not) as a quack.  There are unethical behaviors (such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees) which I would not lable as quackish, but prescribing known ineffective therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a quack. --  David Rind rind@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu
