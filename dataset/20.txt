This is a classic example of excessive faith in reason.  The fact that we have trouble talking about something does not imply that it is impossible; it simply implies that it is hard to talk about.  There is a very good chance that God *can* flibble glop ork groink.  Charlie Wingate can flibble glop ork groink, and he is not even God. -- Doug Graham         dgraham@bnr.ca         My opinions are my own.
