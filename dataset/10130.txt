But Rob Niedermayer is a center, not a defenseman.  I am not sure that the Sharks will take Kariya.  They are not saying much, but they apparently like Niedermayer and Victor Kozlov, along with Kariya.  Chris Pronger is name has also been mentioned.  My guess is that they will take Niedermayer.  They may take Pronger, except that they already have too many defensive prospects.  =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!
