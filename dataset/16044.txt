Miller was convicted of owning a sawed-off shotgun and not paying the NFA \'34 tax.  Snatches of the court is decision:  The Second Amendment was intended to  assure the continuation and render  possible the effectiveness of such a force [the militia]... It must be  interpreted and applied with that end in view.   The militia includes  all males physically capable of acting in concert  for the common defense.   However, regarding sawed-off shotguns,  certainly it is not within  judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military  equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.    Judicial notice  is the term of art here -- it meant that no such evidence had been formally presented.  This is different from claiming that they had ruled that it was not.  > Yes, shotguns had been used in WWI, the Spanish-American War, and the > US Civil War. That was not in question. The possession of a sawed-off > shotgun was, i.e., a weapon altered to improve concealibility.  i am not talking about plain shotguns in war -- i am talking about short- barrelled ( sawed-off ) shotguns in war.  Compare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American  War; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by US soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to  tunnel rats   in Vietnam, but, of course,  Miller  took place in 1939.  > >> Therefore, US vs. Miller supports limited government regulation of  > >> firearms. > > > >do not go arguing down this road unless you are willing to abide by  > >the consequences that you find at the end of it -- mainly, that the > >law-abiding common man has a right to own any weapon that has a militia  > >purpose, from handguns to sawed-off shotguns and fully automatic weapons. > >That, in fact, is what this decision says. >  > You are free to produce evidence that i am not willing to abide with > all the implications of this.   Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of  guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This is not a useful argument  unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs in that class.    I think we both agree that zip guns probably are not protected.  Maybe  we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments  have been banning or trying to ban because they have  no sporting purpose   and  no provate citizen would ever need these guns  DO fall under the  protection of the Second.    So, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at  some time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship  training purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing  this point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.  > Just because I do not whole-heartedly endorse the NRA position does not > mean that I oppose the RKBA.

How many of us feared or abhorred Saddam Hussein five years ago? --   cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\' Packet...
