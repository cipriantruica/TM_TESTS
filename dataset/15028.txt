From: atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Cardinal Ximenez) Subject: Atheists and Hell     Hello,    I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the  newsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.   Unfortunately I do not have direct quotes handy...  1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.  2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death    is unfair.    I do not see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition,  eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  there is no reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough.   Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.  Personally, I do not think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements as metaphorical.
