From: bunt0003@student.tc.umn.edu (Monthian Buntan-1) Subject: Why does Apple give us a confusing message?   Hi there,  Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for C650 regarding fpu?  In all Mac price lists i have seen, every C650 has the message  fpu: optional .  I know from what we have discussed in this newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80 configuration.  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list? i am planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but i am now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not. Why say  optional  if it is built in? Please, anybody help me understand this game.  Regards,  Thian.
