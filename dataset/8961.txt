Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere >was not very fit last year.  Sorry, but this is the biggest load of bunk i have seen in a while.  a) The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now. Nobody was even vaguely interested. b) Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince, who was out of options. c) LaValliere is release had nothing to do with him being through. He was released, because, in the event of an injury to Slaught, LaValliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday catcher.  Since Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties, the offense should actually improve with this move.  Toby
