From: fmg@alpha.smi.med.pitt.edu (Filip Gieszczykiewicz) Subject: Scope questions   \tGreetings. i have been seeing the word  storage  mentioned \taround oscilliscopes but i am curious, what does it mean?  \tIf my life depended on it, i had say that it is a scope that \tuses long-persistance phosphor to keep the successive \ttaces on the screen for some unit of time -  store  them. \tDo I get to live?  \tAlso, i have been shopping for a decent, used, [old] scope \tsince my Tek 514A (portable...NOT!) and my Heathkit O-1000 \tare all single trace and I need more... like 2 or 3 and at \tleast 50MHz (maybe 100...)  \tDuring my shopping at hamfests etc. i have run into the  \tproblem of  old scope  terminology. I can imagine what \ta  mainframe  and  plug-in  are but some things like \tthe above  storage ,  coax input  (Hey, where do I get a  \tprobe that fits this? I had to fiddle with mine for a week  \tbefore I got anything resembling  a good trace  - they all \tcome with BNC connectors!),  unblanking  (huh?), and, oh, \tjust like my 514 manuals, MANY changes were made along the \tway to the schematic - scopes, even with IDENTICAL model  \tnumbers, have different (better?) response/performance than \tothers - how can I pick the better one? Does the rule of the \thigher SN the better apply?  \tTake care. --  / Filip  i shall buy a vowel  Gieszczykiewicz. | Best e-mail  fmgst+@pitt.edu     | All ideas are mine but they can be yours for only $0.99 so respond NOW!!!! |  | I live for my EE major, winsurfing, programming, SCA, and assorted dreams. |   200MB Drive - Linux has 100MB and MS-DOS has 100MB.
