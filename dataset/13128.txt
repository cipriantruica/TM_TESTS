From: koreth@spud.Hyperion.COM (Steven Grimm) Subject: Re: Opinions on Allergy (Hay Fever) shots?  I had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high school.  Before that, I used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacks, and eyes so itchy I could not get to sleep.  After about 6 months on the shots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they have not come back.  I stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college. My allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near as bad as they used to be.  So yes, the shots do work.
