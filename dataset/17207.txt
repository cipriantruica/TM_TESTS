By converting to another religion, you certainly do change your cultural identity, and lose that part of you which was Jewish.   >>At the moment you converted, you officially anounced to the world >>that *you* do not consider yourself to be part of the Jewish Nation. >>So, why should the Jewish Nation consider you to be a member?  >To be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not >by my religion. Actually, if I am an atheist, which is in fact like  >converting into a non-Jewish in terms of religion, I am still considered as >part of the Jewish Nation.  \tNo, there is a serious cultural and religios difference between renouncing the jewish god and accepting a new one.
