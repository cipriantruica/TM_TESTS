Jesus was willing to go through torture to free you from the definite promise of hell (based on Adam/Eve is fall from grace) but rather than allow him to stand in your place, you would give up your redemption to stand with those who do not accept his grace. God would rather have none in hell, which seems to put the burden of  choice on us. Of course, this is all fictional anyway since you reject him also.  My former sociology professor once told us at the beginning of our term,  you all start out with an A...what you do with that during the course of this term is up to you . In the beginning...Adam and Eve were given an A.     Mark Haefner
