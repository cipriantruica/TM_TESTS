Ego got  Absolute nonsense.  The decision that was made was Pocklington is.  He chose  20 mill over Gretzky.  If Gretzky was not upset about not being able to win a cup in LA then I submit that he was not worth the 20 mill.  >the best of him...he thought the supporting cast in Edmonton >did not matter...that he was the show himself.  How do you know what he thinks (or thought)?  The only  thought  that I can see that you have revealed is your own.  You do not like Gretzky. Big deal.  >Now, my only complaint about Lemieux is that he dives too much... >but last year Patrick convinced him twice to accept Bowman and hockey >destiny, rather than his ego.  The real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty.  What the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the ref will not be fooled.  I cannot imagine why anyone would expect someone like Lemieux to change his game.  Why do not you pick on 1 dimensional over-rated type like Hull and Salami.    --   cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca                                              So many morons... rm                                                   ...and so little time.
