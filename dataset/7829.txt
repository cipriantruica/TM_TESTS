When you showin\' up at Highland House? we will compare sunglasses...  let us see how the weather is Saturday or Sunday. It sucks today. What time is good? you are welcome to give any of the ones I have a try.  As for the gargoyles, if you want mine you can have \'em.  I think the bridge of my nose holds them too far from my face. Same deal for the two of my friends who tried them. For people who use them with a full face helmet, all bets are off. Sorry if they fit you well and took my complaint personally. Yes the Oakleys are much more desirable squid attire. Also the gargoyles are not that ugly, even in my opinion, or I would not have tried them.  -- Michael Manning mmanning@icomsim.com (NeXTMail accepted.)  `92 FLSTF FatBoy `92 Ducati 900SS
