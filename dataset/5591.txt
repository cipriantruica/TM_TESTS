From: jc@minya.UUCP (John Chambers) Subject: program to display .gif files?  It seems silly, but while i have located things like tgif that can  edit gif  files, and various tools to convert to/from gif format, I have not been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays  a gif file in it.  i have looked thru various faq files, also to no avail. Is there one lurking about in some  archive?   Nothing  sophisticated; just  show the pretty picture ?  Alternatively, if I could locate the specs for gif, I do not suppose it would be too hard to write it myself, but I have no idea where to even start looking for the spec.  (Well, actually, I do have an idea - this newsgroup.  ;-)   --  If the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would  now cost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times would explode, killing all its passengers.
