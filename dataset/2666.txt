From: brown@NCoast.ORG (Stan Brown) Subject: WinWord -- Spelling Dictionaries for non-US English ?  Word for Windows lets me designate text as being in a language other than US English.  (Alt-F L, Format | Language, as I recall.)  So I mark it for English (UK), but it still accepts  rumor  and squawks at  rumour .  As far as I can see, Microsoft did not include the English (UK) dictionary on my disks.  (I do not mean to imply that I was singled out; I assume that nobody in the U.S got them.)  I dialed the Microsoft BBS, but nothing in the Word for Windows section looked helpful.  Can anyone tell me where or how to obtain the UK spelling dictionary for Winword 2.0?  The file name would be SPELL_UK.LEX or something similar.  Email please; i shall post a summary. --  Stan Brown, Oak Road Systems                    brown@Ncoast.ORG English is my native language and I love it.  But do not try to tell me that it is easy to learn or that it makes sense.  If it were,  baseline  would rhyme with  vaseline .
