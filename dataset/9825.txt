From: seth@cbnewsh.cb.att.com (peter.r.clark..jr) Subject: FLYERS notes 4/17    The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind\'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I did not get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I did not have the best radio coverage either. Here is the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period: \tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51 \tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind\'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period: \tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00 \tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09 \tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind\'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period: \tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp) \tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11 \tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind\'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime: \tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play: \tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies: \tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves) \tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. do not give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, i shall bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  that is all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley   for his career high point total (i am surprised that a former goalie would not look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom   for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi   for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here is the odd part. He could not decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as   after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, does not that make Lindros  ????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...    Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team is record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the \'C\' on his jersey next season.    Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy did not have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also did not play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). there is no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.    Mark Recchi. Again, you cannot argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that did not have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind\'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he was not on the top line this year and did not get as much playing time. Then again, he did not get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he shall score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he shall be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team is point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just cannot argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.  I hope you have all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time almost bearable.
