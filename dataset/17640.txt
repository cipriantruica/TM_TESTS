Look at the whole picture, not just randomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to use  non-initiated force  to achieve its goals, than no special interest can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.  The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic which i shall address briefly.  It certainly will not happen until libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education monopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants  embrace  libertarianism. that is the best means i have seen yet.  We should lobby for compulsory Seminar 1 attendance. :) [in jest!]  Roger Collins  it is amazing to me that governments around the world will try every aspect of government control before, as a final last resort after everything else fails, they will try individual liberty. \t-- Andre Marrou, Libertarian candidate for President \'92
