I went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO.  Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is beyond me; if you cannot handle a stick, you should stick with a regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers. That is not to say that there are not real drivers who cannot use the stick (eg disabled persons), but they are not in any position to use an SHO anyway.   I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic transmissions from all  performance-type  cars (like the 5.0l Mustangs, Camaros, and the like) we would cut down on the number of accidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans, but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO.  \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
