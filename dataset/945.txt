Lindley                      published by Wiley  It addresses reading/writing to/from PCX/TIFF files; image acquisition,  manipulation and storage; and has source code in the book. The source is  primarily written in Turbo C and naturally has conversion possibilities. I  have converted some of it to Quick C. Naturally, the code has some problems  in the book - as usuall. Typos, syntax, etc. are problems. It can be a good  learning experience for someone who is studying C. There is also a companion  disk with source available for order and $50.00. Overall, the book is not  bad. I acquired the book at WaldenSoftware.
