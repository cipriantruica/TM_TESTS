When an animal decides to take you, there is nothing you can do about it.  It has something to do with their genetics.  I was putting along at a mere 20mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it (as in, just like bad concrete), and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped a fence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me!  When I saw her jump the fence I went for the gas, since she was about 20 feet ahead of me but a good forty to the side.  Damn cow literally chased me down and nailed me.  No damage to cow, a bent case guard and a severely annoyed rider were the only casualties.  If I had my shotgun i had still be eating steak.  Nope, if 2200lbs of cow can hit me when i am actively evading, forget a much more manueverable dog.  Just run them over.
