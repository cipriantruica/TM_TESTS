I do not like to see stickwork, but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move (i am a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref is not looking.  Makes \'em go down like a ton of bricks, but does not cause injuries unless they do not know how to fall (i am  talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the  player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of  position for a short time...I do not do this if a shot is likely on the short side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with helpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who I have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he has not a big guy, but he plays huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)  Barfly
