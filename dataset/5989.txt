From: Michelle Zumbo  Subject: DARKROOM SUPPLIES/ENLARGER  FOR SALE:  * Besler 23C II Enlarger       (including filters & negative carriers)  * Darkroom supplies       (containers, trays, thermometer, beakers,       paper focuser, etc...I also have paper &       chemicals, but I think these 2 are past       expiration date)   Everything is in great working condition.  I bought it  about a year ago and it has served its purpose well.   It has not been used it in a few months because I do not  have the time or money to keep up with it and its just  sitting in my bathroom taking up space i had like to use. So, i had like to sell it to someone who would use it  rather than it collect dust in my bathroom.  If you are interested in the whole package, I will sell  everything (including shipping) for $300.  If you have  something else in mind, i am open to suggestions.  Please reply to this account.  Thank you... Michelle
