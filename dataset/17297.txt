History shows that within the last 170 years, Greeks played  that game twice: They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to  instigate the Morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of  the Muslim people. Again, the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V  invited the Russian Czar Nicholas II to invade the Ottoman Empire  \'in the name of Jesus,\' and save his flock from Ottoman rule.

In the words of Professor Skiotis,  With savage jubilance, [the Greeks] sang the words \'Let no Turk remain in the Morea, nor in the whole world.\' The Greeks were determined to achieve to \'Romaiko\' in the only way they knew how: through a war of religious extermination.      >  [42] Ashkenazi Community, Corlu, to AIU no.8783, 2 May 1902, in AIU      Archives (Paris) II C 8, with report printed in El Tiempo of 1 May 1902.
