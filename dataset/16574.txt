Perhaps you heard about >anti-trust in the business world.  \tWere there anti-trust laws in place in mandatory Palestine? Since the answer is no, you are argument, while interestingly constructed, is irrelevant.  I will however, respond to a few points you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.   >They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  \tAnd those fleeing Arab lands, where Jews were second class citizens.   >Plus they paid fair market value, etc...  \tJews often paid far more than fair market value for the land they bought.  >They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy.  \tYou know, Sam, when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like anti-Semitic bull.  \tThe reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple. Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National home for the Jews.  >>>Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it >>>had to maintain a democratic facade (to keep the western aid >>>flowing).  >>\tIsrael got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It >>still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.

Personaly, i have never heard anything about the >arab community in Isreal. Except that they are there.  So >yes, they are there. But as a community with history and >roots, its dead.  \tBecause you have never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant) International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group. The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that do not exist in other democratic states?  \ti have never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab.  He was not really all that different from my other neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?   >I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not >predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no >problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were >predominantly Jewish. So there. what to make of the rest >Palestine?  \tHow recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a Jewish Gaza city.  It would be pretty silly, but I could do it.  i am arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.
