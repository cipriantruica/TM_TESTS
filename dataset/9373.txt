Alomar is a great player, but so is Baerga. >Nice to see the objective source cited rather than  my dad is bigger than >your dad  posts.  I know.  You have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers Alomar to Baerga must be a Jay-Lover and Indian-Hater.  Sorry, you got that one wrong!  I hate the Jays and do not care one way or the other about the Indians.  But objectively, Alomar had the better offensive year last year, so I have to pick him.  You admit T&P as a reliable(?), objective source?  Then you will note that they rated Alomar as the better offensive player, chosing Baerga over Alomar only because of his defense.  that is a joke!  (Alomar might not be a gold-glover, but he has certainly no worse than Baerga defensively.)  -Valentine
