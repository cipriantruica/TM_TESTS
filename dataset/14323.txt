Additionally, there might be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden landing.  Finally, probably some thought went into possible contamination  problems if the instruments came back to earth.  Of course, the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid something that might be done in one shuttle launch.  Here is hoping Cepi is gang gets the job done right the first time.
