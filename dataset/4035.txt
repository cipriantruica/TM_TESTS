From: mmadsen@bonnie.ics.uci.edu (Matt Madsen) Subject: SE/30 acc & graphics card?  Are there any graphics cards for the SE/30 that also have, say, an 040 accelerator?  There seem to be plenty of accelerator/graphics cards for the _SE_, but none (that i have seen) for the SE/30.  Thanks  Matt Madsen mmadsen@ics.uci.edu
