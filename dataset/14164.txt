Let me give you an example.  When you watch TV, they have commercials to pay for the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you do not like it, you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky, and there is a floating billboard out there, you cannot turn it off.  it is the same  reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.  Pat writes: George.  \tit is called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry. If ytou do not like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include a constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental civil rights.  I say:  \tAny reasonably in-depth perusal of American history will show \tyou that many WASPs have continued the practices of prejudice, \tdiscrimination, and violence against others of different \traces, religions, and beliefs, despite the law.  Pat says: If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia, they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums. In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.  I say: What i am objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably, would move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislating at all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, and would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and aesthetic values that make us human.  This includes the need for wild and unspoiled things, including the night sky.
