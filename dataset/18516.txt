What does this say about me?  That you do not recognize the Biblical commentary used.  Those in the church know the language though, and have no such excuse.    >>First Seal in Revelation 6, the entirety of Psalms 45, and the >>most of Revelation 19 -- which demonstrated one of his major points  >>about how the writings in the Prophets (including David), and in  >>the Psalms, and in Revelation are all telling the same story when  >>you understand how they are related (ie have the key).

You missed the point -- which is that the Prophets, the Psalms, and  Revelation, all together, provide a very rich view of a very special event -- a wedding.  >Koresh was a nut, okay?  Just because he found ways for the Bible >to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a kook.  How are you able to make such a conclusion?  Please note, that the first part of Revelation makes it clear that the address is to those in the church. That said, it does not hurt to try to see what the  prophecies are ahead of time -- for those outside the church.  >>Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed >>for the message he carried.  >  >i shall type this very slowly so that you can understand.  He either set >the fire himself or told his followers to do so.  do not make him out to >be a martyr.  He did not  get killed , he killed himself.  So you say. It should be interesting to see what the investigators  conclude, and what the final judgments are.  >>In the mean time, we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption. >>Are you surprised things have gotten that rotten? > >The evil was inside the compound.  All that  thou shalt not kill  stuff.  So much for war and government eh.  >>Oh yeah, one last point for the believers -- Philippian 2:14-19. >  >For the rest of us, could you please post the text?  Very glad you asked, since I goofed -- it should be Philippian 1:14-19:  (here from NIV)  \tBecause of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord \thave been encouraged to speak the word of God more \tcourageously and fearlessly.  \tIt is true that some preach Christ out of envy and  \trivalry, but others out of good will. The latter do so \tin love, knowing that I am put here for the gospel.  \tThe former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not \tsincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for \tme while I am chains. But what does it matter?   \tThe important thing is that in every way, whether from \tfalse motives or true, Christ is preached. And because \tof this I rejoice. \t My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord, are human and imperfect. Whatever we  preach,  no matter how eloquent, or how corrupted -- is of little difference. Those who know the Master is voice will recognize Him -- a gem-stone amidst rock. Such is also the  lesson of the  stumblingblock.  For those who have an ear to hear. \t \t    | -- J --    |    | stephen
