I simply do not like cloth tops, nor the extra insurance, nor the S**** color matching alot of companies do.  If i chose a convertible, it had be:  a) Mazda RX7 II.  I just like the way they look.  it had have to be in black, with color matched black top(they look good!)  b) VW cabriolet.  They do a suberb job of matching colors too.  Also, last year for them!  {***COLLECTOR\'S ITEM****}  c) mustang GT droptop...they look ok too.  i know this does not help, but i thought i had do it anyway...:-)  good luck to your wife.(and you :-)  DREW
