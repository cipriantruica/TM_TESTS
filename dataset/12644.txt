From: jose@csd.uwo.ca (Jose Thekkumthala) Subject: recurrent volvulus      Recurrent Volvulus     -------------------       This is regarding recurrent volvulus which our little boy  has been suffering from ever since he was an infant. He had  a surgery when he was one year old. Another surgery had  to be performed one year after, when he was two years old.  He turned three this February and he is still getting  afflicted by this illness, like having to get hospitalised  for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain.He managed  not having a third surgery so far.    *  \tOne thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction  \tpeaks around the time he was born, on nearabouts, like in  \tMarch every year.  Any significance to this?    *\tWhy does this recur? Me and my family go through severe pain  \twhen our little boy have to undergo surgery. Why does surgery  \tnot rectify the situation?     *\tAlso, which hospital in US or Canada specialize in this malady?    *\tWhat will be a good book explaining this disease in detail?    *\tWill keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of   \trecurrence?    *\tAs time goes on, will the probability of recurrence go down  \tconsidering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably  \tless prone to attacks? Or is this assumption wrong?    *\tAny help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated.  \tThanks very much!    jose@csd.uwo.ca
