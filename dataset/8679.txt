Bob, I think that Stark does this sort of thing as a joke, not as a serious prediction.  I do not really see why we should shoot him for that.  The guys who ought to be shot are the ones who keep claiming how great the Royals\' chances are in the AL West, since all evidence indicates that they are not joking and actually believe it.
