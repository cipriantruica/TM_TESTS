I asked if the deal was good.  It is not.  So it was a complete non-sequitur, is that it?     How does coming up with a derisory deal tell us anything about the existence of  objective  values.  you are asking us to accept that the deal you offered would be turned down, and we believe that, not because we appeal to objective values but becasue we know, or think we know, something about people.  All the people we know exhibit *subjective* values that would lead them to reject a deal of $1 for all of the land in America.  Great.   Now, so what?  jon.
