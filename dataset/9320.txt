Sorry about that.  But Miguel Dilone would >qualify, if I remember correctly.)  When I say  black,  I mean US-born black people for the purposes of this discussion.  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947, and one  team in the 50 is signed lots of hispanics because they went over better with the local audience than blacks did.    >And why would more hispanics stick around than blacks?  do not know.  But remember: this is the country that had special racial laws for one group and one group only: blacks.  Our national history  includes huge, long-term, global tensions regarding the black minority;  the hispanic minority, while often discriminated against, has never been the object of national obsession.  >It might also be worth your while to subdivide the data into careers >starting at 10-year intervals.  I would think that your prediction >would be most true for careers starting in the 1960 is and least true >for careers starting in the 1980 is.  Of course, you had also have to >compare total ML racial percentages for the era in question.  Absolutely.  As I said before, I expect that this effect is disappearing. But it certainly did exist, and all out talk of TWG is and all that is  not without some small reason.  >i am of the opinion that your point is less valid today than it was >25 years ago, but I would be curious to see the data.  Well, there is the list.  Go for it!  i shall cull some more names as I go. I expect you are right, btw.  Roger
