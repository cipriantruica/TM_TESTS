Not an astute observation -- this is a straw-bullpen.  The lefties, Stanton & Mercker are strong, and Wohlers is down learning a new pitch. The bullpen is fine, probably superior.  |> c)over-reliance on Pendleton; a Pendleton slump becomes a team slump. |>   Also false.  Gant, Nixon, Justice, Hunter, Blauser present a decent enough offense.  EVERYONE is slumping (except Blauser), not just Pendleton.  BTW, what is the story with Brian Hunter?  Is he in the dog house?
