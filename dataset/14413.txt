The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says; it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving commands.  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer, I believe the probe starts a  isearch for Earth\' sequence (involving antenna pointing and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish communications.  No-ops are sent periodically through those periods when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows that we have not forgotten about it.  Hope that is clear enough to be comprehensible.   --   Insisting on perfect safety is for people who do not have the balls to live  in the real world.    -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I do not speak for others and they do not speak for me.
