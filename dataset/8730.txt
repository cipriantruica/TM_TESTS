(I do not remember  a 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it is gone now.)  The period length  is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long  as you want, IF he has still certified as injured.  The player must be  periodically re-evaluated to determine if he has still injured (thus you  cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not  wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day  that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I  believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When  there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between  the lists. --King  Sparky  Banaian\t\t\t\t| No taxes:  No new taxes, kbanaian@pitzer.claremont.edu\t\t\t|no old taxes, we are taxed Dept. of Economics, Pitzer College\t\t|enough.  -- Rep.
