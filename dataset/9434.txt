Subject: Yanks over A is George Speaks From: kwolfer@eagle.wesleyan.edu  How about Matt Nokes 2 run single against Ron Darling.  Was that a hit or what?   While watching the game yesterday they flashed up something regarding The Boss\' talking about Mark Connor as bullpen coach.  He said something like it is Mark Connor is fault that the bullpen is so horrible!!  Here we go again!!  George sticking his non-baseball nose in the baseball business.  Shut up George, just spend the money, get the players and leave Buck and the coaches and players alone.
