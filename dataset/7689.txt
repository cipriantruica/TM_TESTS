This is where I came in.  Obcountersteer:  For some reason, i have discovered that pulling on the wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  For example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn  right (Hi, Lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.  Maybe I need psychological help.  Obcountersteer v2.0:Anyone else find it ironic that in the weekend-and-a- night MSF class, they do not mention countersteering until after the first day of riding?    ----- Tommy McGuire, who has going to hit his head on door frames the rest of     the evening, leaning into those tight turns.... mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com   ...I will append an appropriate disclaimer to outgoing public information, identifying it as personal and as independent of IBM....
