From: durtralp@ux1.isu.edu (Ralph Durtschi) Subject: Re: IIsi clock upgrade  Hi, I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought I would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length).  To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on. \t1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case. \t2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables, \t\tspreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out. \t3. Remove the flopy drive. \t4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting \t\tthe supply straight up and out. \t5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom \t\tside of the fan and lifting straight up and out. \t6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and \t\tright side of the board and sliding the board forward then \t\tlifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the \t\tboard must be removed first) \t7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules). \t\tThis is not easy even for a skilled solderer. \t8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins \t\tby pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers. \t9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder  \t\tthem in. \t10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock. \t11.Put large power transistor heat sink is on the processor chip and  \t\tthe other large chip just to the right of the processor and \t\tfigure some way to hold the heat sync is in place. I made a \t\tsimple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole \t\tin the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using \t\tinsulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat \t\tsync is to hold them in place. do not use too much pressure.  \t12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.  Disclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone. \t    You are on your own for this procedure. i am quite sure it will \t    void your warentee.
