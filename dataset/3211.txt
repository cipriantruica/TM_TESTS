From: gt3635a@prism.gatech.EDU (Greg \'Spike\' Bishop) Subject: HELP!!!  My ESDI is posessed by demons!   HELP!  I really got ripped off and I need some help unripping myself.  I bought a Maxtor 4380 300mb ESDI HDD from Hi-Tech for $300, then paid to get it repaired, for about another $300.  Here is the deal:  The thing works fine!  It low level formats, etc without any bad spots at all!  AND THEN... (Jaws Music) sectors start going bad!  EEK!!!  One at a time.  Norton disk doctor keeps marking some U and some C.  That FIXES it.  For about 5 minutes.  Then next day when I run NDD on it again: NO DICE more uncorrectable and correctable sectors.  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure:  Ok, NDD is just not being thurough enough, i shall use Spinrite, I heard that works well.  What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!!   AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to be getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted again the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so.  i am so pissed off right now i am considering buying another HDD, and I really cannot afford it.  i am using SMARTDRIVE, and WINDOWS 3.1 (i am not using the 32 bit disk access though, I know that can create problems).  The disk is using the second option to trick the controller into thinking it is got less then 1024 cyls, and everything else selected is standard, maybe I need to use a different head skew or something?  I do not know.  ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM PLEASE TELL ME HOW!!!! HELP!!!! --  GT:  Designing tommorow the night before with yesterday is technology.
