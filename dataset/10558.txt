The Canucks tied up the Jets so tightly that I thought that they were mailing them.  BTW, Greg...next time, do not fall asleep in geography class, it is pretty sad when a fellow in Norway can spell Winnipeg properly and a guy in North America cannot.  One more thing...how LONG has Vancouver been in the NHL?  How many championships do they have?    Oh yeah...and I CAN go to the Arena and see not one, not two, but *six* championship banners hanging from the rafters.  3 Stanley Cup banners, and 3 Avco Cup banners.  My NHL guide says that Vancouver has won the Cup once (as many times as the rockin\' town of Kenora has won it!)
