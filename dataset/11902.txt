I had the pleasure of doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty at full speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH.  Now if you go a high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 MPH out of it.  (If you speedo does not burn out.)  Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mile odometer would take 22 days or so.  Much easier just to take the speedo apart.  Thought i had share.
