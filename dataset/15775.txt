(I do not know. have not used one in 20 years)         Money orders operate pretty much like checks, with both parties being supposed to sign them.  I assume you had have to show the buy-back people an ID, and you had then have a money order made out to that ID.           As far as traceable as a practical matter, I do not know, it would depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient is name is on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.  i had say certainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who they gave money orders out to.  >Is that even an issue if the weapons are not checked for being stolen?         There might be some questions asked, I suppose, if somebody  brought in a number of weapons each time over a series of  buy back  programs.           ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.
