This engine is a *MIGHTY BORING* piece of junk with approx 140hp. does not like revs at all.  If you look at the DeLorean in the movie Back To the Future you will note that they changed the engine sound to a big V8. A real DeLorean does not sounds half as good. You will also note that every time they have to spin the tires in the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean cannot make a burnout on a dry road! The weak engine thats mounted over the rear axle makes it almost impossible.  Markus >Larry Smith (smith@ctron.com)  No, I do not speak for Cabletron.
