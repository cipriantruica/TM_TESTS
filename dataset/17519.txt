I.e., when hell freezes over.  Why do not you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes? Blacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal system, blacks would be disproportionately represented.  (Note: black vs. white crime rates is not a racial thing.  it is probably an economic thing: poor people are more likely to commit crimes, and blacks are more likely to be poor.  The way to reduce the proportion of minorities in prison is to increase the wealth of minorities.)  --Tim Smith
