From: ewl@world.std.com (Erich W Lantz) Subject: >80 col. mail messages in MS Windows editors  I have a modest system of aliases/macros that enables me to download mail from a public access UNIX system to my MS-DOS box. I read and reply to the mail with a MS Windows 3.1 based editor.  Everything works peachey keen as long as the author of the message has maintained his text at 80 col. max. width. Sometimes I get slightly wider messages that run off-screen, so I have to use the cursor/slider to read the whole thing.  i am using NDW Deskedit mainly, but i have experienced the same prob with all other MS WIndows editors. i have fiddled with word wrap settings in the various editors, but to no avail. I know i am missing something very basic in editor setup, but what is it?  Oh yeah, MS Word for Windows converts everything flawlessly but for what i am looking for that is like using a tank to crack walnuts.  i had really like to have an editor setup that would display all incoming ASCII files in a readable format to my screen.
