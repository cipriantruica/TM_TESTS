This one should not even take you three guesses.  Compared to the Second Amendment?  I think it is worse.  The problem is, the devil is in the details.  You know, the Brady Bill sounds like a  good idea  too, until you discover that there is NO check, and that the police DON\'T have to allow your purchase even if you check out, and that you have NO recourse if they do not.  Are there any loopholes here?  i am no lawyer, I cannot be sure.  I would have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the Brady Bill, for example.  The more words involved, the more details.  What was that saying about Abraham Lincoln requiring 200 words to free the slaves, and the modern Congress requiring 3,000,000 words to describe price controls on rice?  > If there is a good enough show of support for HR 1276, maybe for a change > _we_ could be the ones saying  it is a reasonable first step  ...  That only works with bad laws.  Good laws are like good computer programs.   Quality has to be written in from the start, not added on later. --   cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\' Packet...
