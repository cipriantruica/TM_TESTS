Again, I said to get a CORRECT version of the Constitution.  The first indicator that something is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern capitalization rules.  The next thing to go is the spelling, and then i have even seen versions where the GRAMMAR was modernized (oh, but do not worry, modernizing the grammar will not change the meaning of the text, right?... ;-)  [p.s.
