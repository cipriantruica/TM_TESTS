From: dotsonm@dmapub.dma.org (Mark Dotson) Subject: Re: Hell_2:  Black Sabbath  : I may be wrong, but was not Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath?  he has a : MAJOR brother in Christ now.  He totally changed his life around, and : he and his wife go on tours singing, witnessing, and spreading the : gospel for Christ.  I may be wrong about Black Sabbath, but I know he : was in a similar band if it was not that particular group...     Yes, but Jeff also speaks out against listening to bands like Black Sabbath. He says they are into all sorts of satanic stuff. I do not know.                            Mark (dotsonm@dmapub.dma.org)
