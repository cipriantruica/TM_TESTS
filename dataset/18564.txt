No doubt this accounts for a  significant amount of the time as government efficiency in spending our tax dollars would certainly seek its absolute minimum in such an event.  But my gut instinct says there is more at hand.  It took some careful preplanning to demonize D.K. to such an extent.  The attack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation that seems to be the agenda of the day.  It also fits a pattern of increased government interference in personal religious beliefs.

I certainly think publication of the warrant undermines the government is case since it makes no claims of illegal action.  Therefore the federal judge had reason to seal it.  But I am reminded of Senator Frank Church is remark that  secrecy is the trademark of a totalitarian government.  There is rarely sufficient motive to seal a warrant in a nation of free people. >  > \to  There was probably no one actually exercising oversite. > \t   Instead, a system of bureaucratic rules has been set  > \t   up for such incidents.

I have long suspected that the government has become a mindless machine and now you go and confirm my worst fears!  Has it become a BEAST that is programmed simply to say  Kiss my toe and you get your piece of the pie?  I suspect bugs in the program arise when agents or those who love this critter have independent thoughts.   > \to  What they were after, generally speaking, is protecting > \t   their jobs, budgets, and paychecks.
