When I got my two piece, I got the jacket in 42 and the pants in 40 (just due to my manly-man of an athletic build, kind of thing)  No laughing, please.  Seriously, i am not trim and the 42 pants would have been way too big.  Also, I do not think the 1 piece does provide better protection.  If i am wrong, i shall be swiftly if ever so gently correct by the net.pansies.of.knowledge (as they like to call themselves).
