It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.  No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing so loudly, that it is quite remarkable that I was able to come to a stop with the rubber side up.  The duck, BTW, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.  The bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to my belly button.  Regards, Charles DoD0.001 RZ350 --  Within the span of the last few weeks I have heard elements of separate threads which, in that they have been conjoined in time, struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing gourd. --Unknown net.person
