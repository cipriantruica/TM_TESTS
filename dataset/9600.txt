Huh?  The 20 is and 30 is were the *worst* decades for great pitching.  Grove, Vance, Dean, and not a whole lot else.    As for the best all-around hitters, stat-wise, Ruth, Gehrig, Foxx, Greenberg, Hornsby, Cobb, etc. all played before the 40 is.  Stat-wise, the 60 is were  a graveyard for hitters.  >Now we have a great number of great >pitchers and an equally great number of great hitters and fielders. (Also,  How do you know?

The  So?  Sheffield also has better shoes.  More time between pitches.  You can run the comparison, but there are *lots* of things to take into account.  >same could be said for Frank Thomas who is said to be the best hitter since Ted >Williams, although Frank is defense does suck.  Well, can we compare them or cannot we?  >\tAll I am saying is that you cannot compare players from different era is, >if you want a best player try choosing best players from different era is. That  Why?  We can compare players to the *standard* of their era; and we can keep in mind era-to-era differences without throwing up our hands in despair.  >way there is reasonable basis for comparison.  You have not shown us what is *un*reasonable about the MAntle-Sheffield comparison that you yourself did.  Roger
