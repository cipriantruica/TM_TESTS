From: smithr@teecs.UUCP (Robert Smith) Subject: Re: Conductive Plastic, what happened?  If you are thinking of reactive polymers they are making ESD safe contau\x08iners out of it. As far as being conductive goes anything with a resistance less than 10 to the fouth\x08\x08rth power ohms per cubic measure is classed as conductive per MIL-STD-1686 for ESD protection.
