They could have COME OUT.  Then by your logic, the Jews in Europe in the 1930 is were the cause for the Holocaust.

As you point out everwhere but here, it is irrelevant to this case.

Their refusal to submit to unconstitutional laws?  Their refusal to behave like cowards?  Some of Texas\' heros could have taken the cowardly way out too and surrendered the Alamo.  After all, all they had to do was COME OUT.  They stayed as you say by their  OWN CHOICE .  Problem is not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of insurmountable odds.  But as you point out, they certainly do have that right.    >If they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would >have been no raid, no siege, and no deaths.

The third was to stay inside.  Bull.  They did, in fact, live a quiet, religious life -- as they claimed. The warrant was not issued because they  stockpiled weapons .  It is not against the law to own as many guns as you want -- yet (Except in  Virginia).The warrant was issued for some  gun parts  that are about the size  of a half-dollar.  Certainly worth the lives of so many people, do not you  think?  >Just as we do not blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy >weapon at him, I do not think the FBI deserves blame in this case.
