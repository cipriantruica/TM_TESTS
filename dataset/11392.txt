From: strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) Subject: Re: Clipper considered harmful [Restated and amplified]   Brad Yearwood posts a long response to the issue of registering a phone-clipper relationship.  It does not wash.  Recall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect is phone calls. They do what they do now--figure out which lines to tap. They then record the stuff. If it is Clipper, they read the law enforcement block, extract the serial number, and get the keys using the court order.  No new difficulties (such as using someone else is phone instrument or phone line) are introduced that would not have existed absent clipper. If the crooks were going to use a pay phone (say), they could have done so without clipper. If the government figures out they are so doing, they listen in, and if it is a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys.  If the crooks use an innocent person is clipper phone on the tapped line there is no problem. The Feds do not care whose phone instrument is used, just that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line. They get the serial number, get the keys, and they are in business.  No clipper chip to person association is ever needed.
