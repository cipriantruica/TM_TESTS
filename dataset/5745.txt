Now, when I buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, i shall specify that I only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to UPS), as i have been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg. I will never use a mailing service unless I do not have the right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. i shall also tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.  Other things to watch out for/consider:  \tThe rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.  \tFor a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate \tof $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the \tsame weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many \tcities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox \toperator told me I was not telling the truth about \tcompetitors\' rates, said RPS was unreliable (i have used them \tbefore with NO problems), etc. Right.  \tA COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local \tMailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the \tremade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the \tUPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)  \tFor packages over $100, they charge you about double over \twhat UPS charges them for insurance. i have never had \ta claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?) \thave told horror stories about them...  \tAll package traces have to be done through Mailbox by \tMailbox.  \tOur local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I \tasked him why their rates were stratospheric compared \tto direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...  \tTheir UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex is economy \tair rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!  \tUPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas! \t --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.
