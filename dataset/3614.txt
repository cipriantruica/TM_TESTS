From: ins413j@mdw056.cc.monash.edu.au (Markfried Fellensiek) Subject: Diamond Products Boycot?   Diamond Video cards (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...)  may have excellent specifications, and the windows drivers that come with them might make windows BLINDINGLY fast, BUT:  If you are considering buying a system, with a view to using it to run Unix (Linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special software, there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards. This is due to Diamond is propriety attitude to it is hardware: it is impossible to get free information from them about their chips  (specifically their dot-clocks) without paying, and signing non-disclosure agreements.  This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide X-Windows compatibility with these cards, as diamond did not want to  divulge programming neccessities.  As far as I know only Diamond has this propriety on it is info.   Mark.
