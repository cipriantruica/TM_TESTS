As far as i have heard, unless the owner is _very_ hard up, the GT-40s are not for sale at any price that mere mortals could afford.  >And maybe the Mustang >will be forever King of the Road, the GT-40 is not road legal.  I think the GT-40 actually _is_ street legal, although that particular question is moot (see the price figures below).  >This car was right hand drive (were not they all like that?). How much does >a GT-40 go for? How many were made?  I wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40 registry (as of \'88 or so). There were precious few of them made  (fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough to qualify for the Manufacturer is Cup, or whichever series it was that Shelby broke Ferarri is 13-year winning streak in in \'65), and they are all accounted for. The last price I saw estimated on a GT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that is right, ONE MILLION US DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari that it would blow the doors off of ;-).  I do not recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although i am certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify for racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think,  and/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They also used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the original trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was rear-engine, rear-drive, with the  bundle of snakes  exhaust headers...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I cannot remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe...i shall try and find that reference.  \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
