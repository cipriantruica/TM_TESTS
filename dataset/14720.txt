Tsk.tsk. Too much argument on non-issues ! i am Roman Catholic and it seems to me that people celebrate Easter and Christmas for itself rather than how it relates to Jesus. I do not really care about some diety. If people have some other definition of Easter, then that is their business. do not let it interfere with my Easter.   Resurrection Sunday  8-) Where did that come from ? If people celebrate Easter for the Cadburry bunny, that is their business.   > > So from this I infer that there are different rules for > > Christians of Jewish descent?
