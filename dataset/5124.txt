From: mitch@unidata.ucar.edu (Mitch Baltuch) Subject: motif based graphing package   i am in need of a motif-based graphing package to integrate into a large software package under development for distribution to universities.  it can be either public domain or commercial, although a commercial package cannot have royalties required for binary only distribution.  we need 2-d graphing capabilities at a minimum, but 3-d  would be nice.  any info would be appreciated and i will summarize if there is interest.  thanks, mitch -- _______________________________________________________________________________ Mitchell S.
