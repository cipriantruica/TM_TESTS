For instance, the goal of natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps.  It was not really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions to this were necessary.  Intelligent animals have different needs than the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more complicated than  the law of the jungle.   I do not think that self-actualization is so subjective as you might think.  And, by objectivity, I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be carried out completely.  keith
