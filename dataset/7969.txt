Any chance you can get to him and convince him his ruling was backward, Nick?  \tPerhaps the lad deserved something for starting a brawl (bad form... horribly bad form,) but for getting drunk?  That, I thought, was ones natural born right!  And for spending his own money?  My goodness, who cares what one does with one is own moolah, even if one spends it recklessly?  \ti am ashamed of humanity.  \tMatt Block                  &         Koch \tDoD#       \t\t\t1980 Honda CB650
