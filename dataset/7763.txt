Just make sure they are tied down tight in front and no problemo.  ^^^^ \tHmm, sounds like a useful trick -- it had keep the local cagers at least a crutch-length off my tail-light, which is more than they give me now.  But do I have to break a leg to use it?  \t(When I broke my ankle dirt-biking, I ended up strapping the crutches to the back of the bike & riding to the lab.  It was my right ankle, but the bike was a GT380 and started easily by hand.)  Ivan Reid, Paul Scherrer Institute, CH.     \t\t\tivan@cvax.psi.ch GSX600F, RG250WD.
