From: lovall@bohr.physics.purdue.edu (Daniel L. Lovall) Subject: Buick heater controls  I have a \'71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it.  I bought it in California, and if it shall let me, i had like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls do not work.  The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is stuck in the  vent  mode.  It will blow warm air, but I cannot switch the air flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I cannot  live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the  defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.  I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.  Two questions:  \t1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than \tthe fact that I should move from Indiana) ?  \t2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms are not available, is there \ta way to  fix  this?  THanks for any advice/info  selah,  Dan lovall@physics.purdue.edu
