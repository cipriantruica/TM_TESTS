From: Patrick Walker  Subject: They guy who bad-mouthed Ulf...  Ditto...  If we allow people like him to continue to do what he does, it is a shame.  People say that cheap shots and drawing penalties by fake- ing is part of the game, I say  Bullsh-t! .  If he ever tried some like that on a Yzerman, he had would have to deal with Probert now would not he?  What Ulf does is not even retaliatory!  there is now way one could justify what he does and if they do they are fools.    /---- ==========/  Patrick Walker / /--  =========/   University of New Brunswick I I()I ======/      Canada    --/ /            Detroit Fan Extraordinaire.   ----/
