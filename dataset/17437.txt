This is relevant because granting a right to one class of persons  |by definition ALWAYS impinges on the rights of another class or classes or |persons, to some degree. In the case of abortion, establishing rights for |the unborn impinges GREATLY on the rights of pregnant women. There has yet |to be presented a sufficient justification for such fetal rights.  Not to your satisfaction. But the arguments have convinced me, and others. --  Mob rule is not any prettier merely because the mob calls itself a government It am not charity if you are using someone else is money.
