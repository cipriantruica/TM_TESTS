I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that Ottawa is gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne\'t liked, and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being stupid, he has really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a rock.   Also remember that a lot of teh  draft 1st  stuff comes from the assumption he shall be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. it is not clear that  Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status. he has still first round, but I do not consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point.  it is also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos suspensions.  >IMO I would >take Kariya.

No. Kariya will not go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he has not leaving college, and I do not believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who will not be around for another year or two, not when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can convince him to leave school early (which I doubt).   My cut on things as they stand today:  >Draft Order >----------- >1) Ottawa (60% Daigle, if not, 40% Pronger) >2) San Jose 80% Niedermayer, unless Ottawa skips Daigle. Then it is open. \t(it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him. I do not \tbelieve they draft him to keep him). >3) Tampa Bay (whoever Ottawa does not take, or maybe Koslov)  --   Chuq  IMHO  Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com    Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ    Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)   San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)
