From: dwarner@sceng.ub.com (Dave Warner) Subject: Sabbatical (and future flames)  So, I begin my 6 week sabbatical in about 15 minutes.  Six wonderful weeks of riding, and no phones or email.  I will not have any way to check mail (or setup a vacation agent, no sh*t!),  though I can dial in and get newsfeed, (dont ask), so if there are any  outstanding CFC is or such things,please try my compuserve address:  72517.3356@compuserve.com  Anybody wants to do some WEEKDAY rides around the BA, send me a mail to above or post here.  i shall be thinking about all of you stuck if front of your terminals...... Sheeyaahhh, and monkeys might fly out of my butt...  ride safe, dave    -------------------------------------------------------------------------                            Sense AIN\'T common....
