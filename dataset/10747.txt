The plaintext that is relevant is the session key. If you know that, you probably do not need a roomful of chips, do you? If you were going to brute force something interesting, that had be the message stream, which is sort of approximately known by, say, a bug in my office. Then your roomful of chips could get the session key. Which I change every morning.  \tReally, it is just a whole lot easier for the illicit wiretappers to stick a bug in your phone.  \tAndrew Molitor
