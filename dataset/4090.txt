From: pilon@aix02.ecs.rpi.edu (T.J. Pilon) Subject: My IIcx will not turn on...  Anyone know what would cause my IIcx to not turn on when I hit the keyboard switch?  The one in the back of the machine does not work either... The only way I can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes, then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately... Sometimes this does not even work for a long time...  I remember hearing about this problem a long time ago, and that a logic  board failure was mentioned as the source of the problem...is this true?   \t\tThanks, \t\tT.J. Pilon \t\tpilon@rpi.edu
