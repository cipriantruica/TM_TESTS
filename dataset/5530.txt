From: smeets@speedy.cci.de (Vincent Smeets) Subject: Sun 3/80 with SunOS 4.0.3 as X-Terminal  At the moment, I am using a Sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with SunOS 4.0.3 and OpenWindows 2.0.  This configuration is slow and I cannot run all the programs on OW2. For example, when I start a mailtool from OW3 and display it on my OW2 display, I cannot open the compose window.  I want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes, we have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start the X programs.  Is there a  ready to go  binairy of the X11 server for my configuration (I have read something about Xsun), or must I compile the X11 stuff by myself?  Any help is welcome  \tV.
