From: hunter@nsslsun.nssl.uoknor.edu (Steve Hunter) Subject: Minnesota Shame?  i am a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best I can here in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma).  i am hoping I can get a reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas.  i have been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly, THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in Texas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging?  As much as i had like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me, I cannot help but feel for the people in Minnesota, unless they truly did not support the team.    Opinions, please.
