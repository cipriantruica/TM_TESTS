We do not want to spend too much money preserving lives, after all.  Escpecially when they are all just a bunch of crazy fanatic cultists anyway, instead of normal people.  [The above is supposed to be dripping with sarcasm, but i am too burned out right now (get it?  burned out  ha ha!) to tell if it is working. Look, folks, what David Koresh and his followers were was _broken_.  It takes a certain amount of flexibility and insanity to survive in this world and they did not have enough of it and that was not their fault.  So please stop dancing on their graves, okay?]  -- William December Starr
