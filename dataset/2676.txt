From: bilan@cps.msu.edu (Thomas J Bilan) Subject: W4WG & Novell  I installed Windows for Workgroups on my network and i am having problems  mapping drives in the file-manager.  Situation: If I put LASTDRIVE = Z in my config.sys, NETX will run but I cannot access drive f: to log in to Novell.   If I do not put LASTDRIVE = Z in my config.sys I cannot access other W4WG  drives from the file-manager.  It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE =  statement in my Config.Sys.  I would appreciate any help.  it is probably an easy problem that all you  Windows guru is solved many many moons ago...
