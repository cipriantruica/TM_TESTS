Ranford, Tugnutt, Benning, Manson, Smith, Buchberger, and Corson are playing for Canada.  Podein and Weight are playing for the US.  Is Kravchuk playing for the Russians...I know he had nagging injuries late in the season.  Podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to play in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev, Zubov, and Andersson...obviously Sather and Pocklington are not the total scrooges everyone makes them out to be...certainly in this case they have massively outclassed Paramount and the New York Rangers.
