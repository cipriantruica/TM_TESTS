From: chips@astro.ocis.temple.edu (Charlie Mathew) Subject: Interdisc. Bible Research Inst.     Hi!  \tAnyone know anything about the Interdisciplinary Bible Research Institute, operating out of Hatfield, Pa?  \ti am really interested in their theories on old-earth (as opposed to young earth) and what they believe about evolution.  \tThanks, \t\tIn the Master,  \t\tCharley.   --        Seek God and you will find, among other things,                           piercing pleasure.                Seek pleasure and you will find boredom, disillusionment                               and enslavement.
