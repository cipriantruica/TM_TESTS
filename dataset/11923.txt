Hence big cooling towers.        as a point of info, some of the early nuclear power plants in this country used the fission pile as a first stage to get the water hot, and then had a second stage -fossil fuel- step to get the water (actually steam) VERY HOT.     I remember seeing this at Con Edison is Indian Point   power plant, which is about 30 miles north of NYC, and built more or less 1958.   dannyb@panix.com  (all the usual disclaimers apply, whatever they may be)
