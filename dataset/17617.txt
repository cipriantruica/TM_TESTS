Tell      me, how many pro-choicers have compared abortion in a clinic to a      religious ritual in a church?  i shall bet that you have seen  overwhelming      support  for this opinion in some newsgroup or another.      In article <15313@optilink.COM  cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer) writes:    No, but i have seen the comparison drawn by pro-choicers in ca.politics.    It is worrisome to me.  But not to you?      1. i have been reading ca.politics for a while now, and I do not recall      seeing such a comparison.  You do not read *my* postings very carefully; i am not surprised.  It was pretty shocking, and is part of why my sympathy (though not agreement) with the pro-lifers is increasing.    2. A handful of lunatic opinions expressed in ca.politics does not      make me think that the opinion is widely held.  When did I say that it was?    Clayton, I wish I knew what made you tick.  Your math sucks, and you   take single instances of fringe opinions and proclaim the existence of   a pernicious trend.  there is about a quarter billion people living in   this country -- some small number of them are almost guaranteed to   hold opinions that you (and I) find positively repellent.  As long as   the small number is truly a small number, and as long as they are not   my neighbor (highly likely), i am not worried about it.  When they hold high public office, you should worry.    By the way, when you cite experts, remember that Carl Sagan and Paul   Ehrlich [sp?] are experts, too.  If i have never heard of your experts,   i shall consider the source (you, a man who is clearly unable to master   elementary statistics and uses of statistical inference) and ignore   them.
