If life were so simple!  Savard has not played in three of the last  four games and they are still playing like crap.  Montreal is problems run deeper than Savard (and Mouton) unfortunately; I hope they can get their act together before the playoffs.  The line-up in their game coming up against PittsburgH is said to be the one they are likely to use for the playoffs.  let us hope they can forget about the nice weather we are having and play hockey. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul Valin                                     Tel: + 1 613 763 7394 Bell-Northern Research Ltd.
