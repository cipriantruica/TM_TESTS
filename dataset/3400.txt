Subject: Need help/info on Hard Drive terms From: carlson@ucunix.san.uc.edu (David Carlson)  Hi all.  i have been installing a new hard drive recently and have run into several terms that i am not sure about.  1.) Hard Sectored/Soft Sectored -- what is the difference?  How do I know which to use?  2.) Head Skew & Cylinder Skew -- I understand that these are related to performance... How do I know what is optimal?  My drive is an ESDI drive, if that makes a difference in discussing these terms.  \t\tAny info/help is greatly appreciated!  \t\t\t\tDavid \t\t\t(carlson@ucunix.san.uc.edu)
