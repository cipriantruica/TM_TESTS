From: Thomas Parsli  Subject: Re: Change of name ??   How we survived ww2: We mailed postings about things we did not know any thing about to ONLY the wrong places.  i am NOT trying to censor this or any newsgroup, i am just trying to give some hints about OTHER newsgroups. does not this belong to alt.conspiracy ??  NOTE!!! My posting was in reply to those about FBI torching the plasce after filling it with napalm, and arrested people dissapering.  >We all know what a quisling is, right? Obviously we do not..... Vidkun Quisling is known to be a traitor in Norway, not a \'censor\'. If I have betrayed my country (Norway) bescause I implied that som of  you jumped to conclusions/sound a little paranoid then I think there is a LOT of quislings in Norway.......   About Waco It looks to me as the BATF and FBI cannot handle situations like this. The way it went reminds me of  istun\' bomb beeing dropped on a house in LA from a helicopter. (Whole block went up in flames, 5 died...)  It does not HAVE to be a conspiracy, MAYBE they just screwed up ???    \tThis is not a .signature. \tit is merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith \tand to bring down the evil Internet.
