The government decided to  discourage  them.     you are blowing smoke.  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas    markets like Japan and the EC.  The government told them  do not do encryption    if you ever hope to export this technology .  The reason that CDMA does not    have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a\'knocking at Qualcomm is door.    it is because Qualcomm does not think that the US market for digital cellular    is big enough for them.  This is just the International Traffic in Arms    Regulations all over again.  Perry has already stated on the net that Qualcomm wanted to sell overseas, and the government told them they would not be allowed to export, so he has only blowing the same smoke you are :-) Sure, they probably could have made a US version, and a non-crypto export version, and contracted with a Bulgarian or Japanese software house to develop an overseas crypto ROM, but that is getting pretty expensive.     No, Cylink sells their phones because they are willing to make different    stuff for domestic use vs. export.  Qualcomm is not.  So Cylink makes    money--that is capitalism, comrade.  Well, some people like capitalism, and others prefer free enterprise; they are different!  Using the government to stifle your competition is capitalist.     >Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this.

If you think it is so easy, why are    you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it?  Writing good crypto code is something most good programmers can do; writing good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill. Developing new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized, but finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you do not have enough horsepower is still fairly hairy stuff. Once the 586/Pentium becomes widespread, or the next generation of sound boards has DSPs on it, I suspect we will see it happen. Maybe the vanilla 486+Soundblaster is enough. --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
