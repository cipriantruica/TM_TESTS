Here is the fixed patch:  The patches for xv.h need to use ``  SVR4\'\' rather than the overly complex ``#if defined(sun) && defined(SYSV)\'\' in order to generically compile XV on i386SVR4Architecture.  Also, rand and srand do not work very well--use lrand48 and seed48 to get better results. Otherwise, xv-3.00 compiles just fine on my Esix System V 4.0.4 box with XFree86 and gcc-2.3.3.  I just uncommented the gcc definition in the Makefile, added -L/usr/X386/lib -I/usr/X386/include to the COPTS line and modified LIBS to include -lsocket -lnsl.  Really John, if you just use the Imakefile things like this do not even have to get mentioned...  *** 1.1\t1993/04/28 08:33:13 --- xv.h\t1993/04/28 17:47:38 *************** *** 284,292 **** --- 284,298 ----         /* signal macros */ +   SVR4 +   HOLD_SIG         sighold(SIGALRM) +   RELEASE_SIG      sigrelse(SIGALRM) +   PAUSE_SIG        sigpause(SIGALRM) +       HOLD_SIG         sigblock(sigmask(SIGALRM))     RELEASE_SIG      sigblock(0)     PAUSE_SIG        sigpause(0) +           /* default for most folks */ *************** *** 318,323 **** --- 324,333 ----     random  rand     srandom srand     +   SVR4 +   random lrand48 +   srandom seed48 +
