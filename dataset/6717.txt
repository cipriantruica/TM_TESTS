I may be wrong, but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL2.  \tI agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000 if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little inaccurate.  > >\tI cannot see Saturn is of better value and that is why I was puzzled >\tby its pricings. Oh, we did not spend much time getting our deals; >\tbeing better informed has its advantages.  Well, that is ok.  At least you are not bitching about dealer profits like some of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that is best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by the Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.  >\t >\tThen again, I may be wrong. > >Yung-Kao Hsu >  Mihir Shah mps1@cec1.wustl.edu
