From: jhpb@sarto.budd-lake.nj.us (Joseph H. Buehler) Subject: Re: The Bible on the Immaculate COnception  In article  JEK@cu.nih.gov writes:  \t+  I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and \t+ between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall \t+ crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel. \t+ -Genesis 3.15     In the Hebrew of Genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine.  \t+ HE shall crush your head, and you shall bruise HIS heel.     The Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar.  I have yet to see an adequate explanation of St. Jerome is translation of Genesis 3:15.  His Latin clearly uses the feminine, but I do not know why, since the Hebrew is clearly masculine.  If anyone knows of a scholarly treatment of this puzzle, I would appreciate hearing from you.
