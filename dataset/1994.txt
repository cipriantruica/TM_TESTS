From: rjwjames@waikato.ac.nz Subject: Windows 3.1 Video Driver   i have got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and i am looking for a Windows 3.1 Driver for it.  it is based on the Cirrus Logic CL-GD510A-32PC-B chip.  i have contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand and they say that only Windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer. So if there is a V3.1 driver out for this chip set i had like to know -  preferably by e-mail at rjwjames@waikato.ac.nz                       Thanks is advance  Ross James
