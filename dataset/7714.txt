Always carry  plenty of black-plastic  bin liners  to  Check with the local fire department.  My buddy is a firefighter and they have these small map books which are Amazing!  They are compact, easy to use (no folding).  They even have a cross reference section in which you match your current cross streets with the cross streets you want to go to and it details the quickest route.  They gave me an extra they had laying around.  But then again I know all those people i am not really sure if they are supposed to give/sell them. (The police may also have something similar).   >--  >   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ >  | John Little  - gaijin@Japan.Sun.COM  - Sun Microsystems.
