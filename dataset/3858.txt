How many NuBus slots do you have?  Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they think they open a built-in port.  They also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance) and I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles 8 ports simultaneously.  As I said, with NuBus, you are green. Learn how to use the Comms Resource Manager to get at the various installed cards.  Cheers,  \t\t\t\t\t/ h+   --   -- Jon W{tte, h+@nada.kth.se, Mac Hacker Deluxe --    You NEVER hide the menu bar.
