If it is just microorganisms, those can be filtered or killed, but you may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals. Better be same than sorry.  Obviously, drinking the river without processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      |  Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
