From: healta@saturn.wwc.edu (Tammy R Healy) Subject: getting to the point!  To all a.a readers:      I have been asked be several of you to post a list of the SDA Church is  27 Fundamental beliefs.  I warn you now, it is a long list.  However, i shall  post it on Sunday.  Sabbath is coming up soon so I will not be reading on  Saturday.  And I do not have time to do it now.      I would GREATLY appreciate it if you would keep me in touch with what is  going on.      I hope all of you have a reastful and relaxing weekend.  I hope it is  the best one so far!!  Tammy
