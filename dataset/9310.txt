Deion can be explained as  learning how to play the game .  i am not betting that Deion will be able to play as well as last year, but I think the odds of Deion playing as well or better than he did last year are better than the odds of Otis Nixon doing the same thing.  When you factor in defense, Otis was more valuable last year.  But i am not convinced he shall be more valuable this year, and especially next year. --  Dale J.
