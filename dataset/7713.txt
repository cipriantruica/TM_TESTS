From:  Jae W. Chang   Subject: BMW R65 info wanted   Hi, someone is selling his bmw R65 ( I think it is an \'84 ) w/ 15k miles for $2200. He says it is in great condition and perfect shape. it is got the 2 hard saddle bags, too.   Is this a good deal? Seems like an awesome deal. Is it - assuming that everything he says is true ?  Thanks,  Jae  -------------------------- jae@cmu.edu
