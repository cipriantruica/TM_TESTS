From: C445585@mizzou1.missouri.edu (John Kelsey) Subject: Crypto papers on the net.     i have recently been reading a paper of Merkle is (publixhed only on the net, I think) discussing three potential replacements for DES.  Was anyting ever done with these?  Are Khufu, Khafre, and/or Snefru still being discussed anywhere?  (I know Snefru is referenced in the RSA FAQ, and I think it may also be in the sci.crypt FAQ.)    On a related topic, can anyone point me toward good sites to find papers/articles/discussions of cryptology?  I think i have about exhausted the Math/Sci library here, which does not seem to have anything more recent than about \'84.      Thanks.      --John Kelsey
