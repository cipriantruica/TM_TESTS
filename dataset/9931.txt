From: brifre1@ac.dal.ca Subject: Yet more crazy predictions   Well here it goes...my crazy predictions (which never come true, but hey..)  Adams \tBos vs. Buf - Bos in 5 (cakewalk for the hot Bruins) \tQue vs. Mon - Que in 6 (best series of the first round)  Patrick \tPit vs. NYI - Pit in 5 (NYI wins fourth game) \tWas vs. NJD - NJD in 7 (a grueling upset, possibly OT in game 7)  Norris \tChi vs. StL - Chi in 5 (StL is no match for Keenan is Krew) \tDet vs. Tor - Tor in 6 (Clark steps it up in playoffs this year)  Smythe (who cares?) \tVan vs. Win - Win in 7 (so i am caught up in Teemu-mania, sue me!) \tCal vs. LAK - Cal in 5 (LA sucks!!!!!!!!! IMO)  Division finals \tBos vs. Que - Bos in 7 (killer games, watch for Cam to shine) \tPit vs. NJD - Pit in 6 (NJD go insane, kill all on ice, but Pit wins) \tChi vs. Tor - Tor in 7 (Tor defense finally get it together) \tCal vs. Win - Cal in 6 (Win too tired after 1st series)  Conference finals \tPit vs. Bos - Bos in 6 (Pit too beat up by NJD to play (I hope)) \tCal vs. Tor - Tor in 6 (Vernon turns into a sieve)  Stanley Cup \tBos vs. Tor - Tor in 7 (Two totally different teams, who knows? Dreams \t\t\t\tcan come true, pig might one day evolve wings)  Feel free to laugh at my predictions, I always do!  Barfly
