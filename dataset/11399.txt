The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot?   In a new Civil War?    Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and i am worried  that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens  and paper.

The presence of the POSSIBILITY of using the bullet box instead of the ballot box is supposed to be a deterrent - by keeping the price of massive abuse unacceptable.  However, governments being what they are, sure would like to REMOVE that deterrence, which will make the need for armed citizens all the more great (you do not need \'em till you do not have \'em). Then I think we can be more accurately called  isubjects\' instead of \'citizens\'.  The idea of the people being sovereign over the government is sure not in vogue in the Beltway these days, that is for sure... The Administration is saying  We know best.  We will tell you what you need, or do not need...
