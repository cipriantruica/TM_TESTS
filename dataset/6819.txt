Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators, and i have never  seen nor heard of a vandal opening one.  I imagine that there would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have  to crawl furthur under the car to open it.    Car vandals are usually real traditional in their methods, and do things that do not get them dirty, like keying your car, dumping sand, sugar or mothballs in the gas tank, TPing it, etc.  --  Boycott USL/Novell for their absurd anti-BSDI lawsuit. | Drew Eckhardt Condemn Colorado for Amendment Two.\t\t       | drew@cs.Colorado.EDU Use Linux, the fast, flexible, and free 386 unix       |
