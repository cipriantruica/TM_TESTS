I went with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered lots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce. I thought,  Well, i have only had scallops once and I was sick after but that could have been a coincidence . That night as I sat on the bathroom floor, sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never touch another scallop. I may not be allergic but I do not want to take the chance.
