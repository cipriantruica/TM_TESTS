From: chrisw@yang.earlham.edu Subject: accelerated Mac Plus problems  Hello \tI recently accelerated my Mac Plus (MicroMac 25MHz accelerator)  and now I cannot get my Mac to boot off of the hard disk.  It boots fine  from a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I  cannot get it to boot from the hard drive.  I installed a new driver, so I  do not think that is the problem.   \tThis poses a rather large problem.  I only have 4 Meg of RAM, and  I need to run Mathematica, which requires 5 Meg.  I was hoping to use  system 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica.  However, I cannot  run system 7 from a floppy, so I cannot get enough RAM.   \tAny suggestions? Thanks for your time-- \t\t\t\t\t\tChrisw@yang.earlham.edu
