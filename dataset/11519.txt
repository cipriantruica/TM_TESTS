Someone >posted such an address on CompuServe a few months ago, but apparently >the White House was not really set up to recive hundreds (thousands?)  \tThis is a real address. My understanding of the current process that mail takes is it gets downloaded on floppy disk and is processed by retiree volunteers, who match the message against message profiles and check the message count. (I.e.:  yeah, that is a for gays in the military. what is this clipper stuff? must be against gays in the military... )  \tThe higher-volume white-house email stuff is in the works, I know for a fact, but will not be online for probably another month or two at the soonest. My understanding is that the link speed will increase (direct internet instead of Compu$erve to floppy) but the message processing will remain the same.  >Unless the people at the White House print and distribute this mail >every day, you may have better luck printing out a letter (on paper, >that flat white stuff all over my desk) and Snail-Mailing it to the >White House. I imagine writing to your local representative and >senator would not hurt either. Heck, why not write to Al Gore while >you are at it?  \tThe white house email does get read. I agree that printing it and sending Cc: to everyone you can think of is probably better because it is more visible, but the message processing (fitting messages against a template) is the same in either case.  mjr.
