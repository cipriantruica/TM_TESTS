From: hulthage@morue.usc.edu (Ingemar Hulthage) Subject: Dead mouse ?   My MacClassic mouse died.  I dissected it and determined that it is the microswitch, that senses the click, that is stuck in the depressed mode.  This tragedy prompts the following questions:  1.\tIs it easy to find a microswitch that I could solder into the \tplace of the old switch ?  2.\tI have old mice (Max+, Mac 512Ke), can they be used with some \tadapter ?
