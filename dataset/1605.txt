Sorry, i am not a rayshade user - but hey, it looks like this group could use some traffic.  My guess is that  metallic  is not a color, in the RGB sense.  Rather, it is a matter of how the surface reflects light.  i am not sure what property metallic materials have, that makes them recognizable as such, but i am pretty sure any color material can look metallic.
