Simple stuff, like b&w logos, etc. do pretty well, while more complicated stuff goes haywire.  I suspect (even though I do not write code) that a good bitmapped to vector conversion program would probably be as big as most of these application softwares we are using -- but even so, how come one has not been written? (to my knowledge).  I mean, even Hijaak, one of the commercial industry standards of file conversion, has not attempted it yet.  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Mac McDougald                   *   Any opinions expressed herein   The Photography Center          *   are not necessarily (actually,  Univ. of Tenn.
