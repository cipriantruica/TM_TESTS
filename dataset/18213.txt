And the list you have here is of poorer >quality than most.  I agree, which is why i have asked for help with it.  The reason i am working on this list is because i have recently had one too many Christians tell me  the Bible contains no contradictions whatsoever.   They believe that it is true, and that it describes reality perfectly, and even predicts history before it happens.  Before I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these people, i have got to SHOW them, with concrete evidence, that the Bible is not nearly as airtight as they thought.  I hope to do that with this list.  Specifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two contradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat denials.  i have never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are indeed two different accounts of creation.  --  _/_/_/  Brian Kendig                             Je ne suis fait comme aucun /_/_/  bskendig@netcom.com                de ceux que j\'ai vus; j\'ose croire _/_/                            n\'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent.   /  The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre.  /    is that it ends.                                           -- Rousseau
