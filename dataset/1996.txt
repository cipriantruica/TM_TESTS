I preferred Windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0, but could still run more apps than OS/2 (again I made this choice before 2.0 was released).  >But getting back to the original question, do you have any data on the >relative avaliablity or Windows applications versus OS/2 applications >or any evidence that stated support will be dropped by any of the above?

You at Microsoft >are in a unique position to present facts,   Hmm. Are you sure?  i am speaking from my own experience as an OS/2 _user_. Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group  would be in a unique position to present the results of, say, research on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps). Part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does  not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).  >but prefer to make baseless claims or attack to poster.

You >seem to discount others anyway.  Again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to  sell   readers on our products (which would conflict with the  no-ads   philosophy of usenet).  Nor do we necessarily have access to info that others have.  I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like, members of the BORG.  -jen  --       //  jenk@microsoft.com  // msdos testing
