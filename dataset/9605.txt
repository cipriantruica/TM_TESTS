Then again, we must remember that we are indeed Cub fans, and that the Cubs will eventually blow it.  After all, the Cubs are the easiest team in the National League to root for.  No Pressure.  You know they will lose eventually.  Oh well, I suppose we must have faith.  After all, they do look pretty good, and they do not even have Sandberg back yet.    CUBS IN \'93!!!!!  CHA
