Unfortunately, from time to time we are obliged      to do this immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation, and so      we have to bear the moral consequences of that.          Since both statements, to all intents and purposes, say effectively     the same thing,         Are you serious?  Two statements, one of which says that use of force    in the given situation is moral, and the other of which says it is     moral  say effectively the same thing?       Yes, when you tag on the  Unfortunately, ... , then to all intents and   purposes you are saying the same thing.    Then delete the  unfortunately .   Now tell me that the two statement  say effectively the same thing.    And to save everyone a couple of trips round this loop, please notice  that we are only obliged to use force to preserve self.   We can choose  *not* to preserve self, which is the point of pacifism.  O.K., got you.  I concede your point, though the word  obliged  strongly implies that one must sometimes use force.  A further rephrasing would give you the distinction you mention, however.  If I have you right, a pacifist would not even go on to say,  unfortunately,etc.      Would you say this of any two statements, one saying  X is moral  and     other saying  X is immoral?    How would you decided when two     statements  X is moral   X is immoral  actually conflict, and when    y  say effectively the same thing .      What they prescribe that one should do is a pretty good indicator.    And in this case they do not prescribe the same things, so.....  Yes, fair enough, though why confuse things by saying that  one is  somtimes obliged  if the real meaning is that  one is never obliged .                       and lead one to do precisely the same thing, then      either both statements are doublespeak, or none.        They might lead you to do the same thing, but the difference is what    motivates pacifism so they obviously do not lead pacifists to to the    same thing.      that is not true.  You could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum    force and still be a pacifist.  If the minimum is 0, great  - but one is   always trying to get as close to 0 force as possible under that belief.   Not the same as \'force is immoral, period\', but still tending to pacifism.     you do not think the use of force is immoral, why minimise its use?  If you do not think that it is  immoral, period. .    --  Frank O\'Dwyer                                  \'i am not hatching That\' odwyer@sse.ie                                  from  Hens ,  by Evelyn Conlon
