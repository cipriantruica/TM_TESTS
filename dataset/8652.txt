From: gt0523e@prism.gatech.EDU (Michael Andre Mule) Subject: Re: Tickets etc..  let us look at the effects of inflation on 1930 is superstars\' salaries.  I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  let us assume he made that in 1928 (i am not sure of the figures, but I know i am in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I did not crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today is players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today is average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think i am off by much.
