I realize the off-hand nature of the numbers I used.  And I cannot answer as to what an acceptable loss rate is.  However,  as I said in another post,  I despise the idea of supporting criminals for life.  it is the economics of the situation that concern me most.  The money spent feeding, clothing, housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are unfit to live in society could go to a number of places,  all of which I, and probably others,  would consider far more worthwhile and which would enrish the lives of all Americans.  Give people jobs,  give the homeless shelter.  Any number of things.  Clyde   --  Little girls,  like butterflies, do not need a reason! \t\t\t\t\t- Robert Heinlein
