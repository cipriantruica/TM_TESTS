From: volkert@kub.nl (Volkert) Subject: Q: which of these CD-ROM players would you choose for OS/2?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Netters!  I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought \'Why not ask the net.community\'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper ones that I want to know more. The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening to CD is. Perhaps some day i shall want to use it to read the other CD is, but that is not really relevant at the moment.  i have been offered the following CD-ROM players, for the prices stated. They all claim to have SCSI-I, and operate under OS/2. The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give your opinions on the drives, i have got the impression that they are not all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq.  i have calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. it is actually about times 1.8.  Mitsumi CRMC     $240 Philips LMS-I    $300 Philips 205      $350 Toshiba ?        $370 Nec CDR-74       $650  Who bought that Trantor that is in the faq? it is extremely cheap and SCSI, so what is the trick or where can I order it (Holland using MasterCard).  Trantor T128     $200  regards, JV                                                                 ///// name:    J-V Meuldijk                                          [ o o ] address: gildelaar 4                                             _=_/          4847 hw teteringen       fax:     +3176-600220         _| |_           holland                  e-mail:  volkert@kub.nl      /  _/   _____________________________________________________________oOOO___OOOo__
