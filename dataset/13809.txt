Solar dynamic power (turbo-alternators) does not have this problem.  It also has rather less air drag due to its higher efficiency, which is a non-trivial win for big solar plants at low altitude.  Now, you might have to replace the *rest* of the electronics fairly often, unless you invest substantial amounts of mass in shielding.  >Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted >by international treaty.  References?  Such treaties have been *proposed*, but as far as I know, none of them has ever been negotiated or signed. --  All work is one man is work.             | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
