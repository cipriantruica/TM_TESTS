Can you obtain a CCW in mass.?( for the ordinary citizen )  CCW is are issued at the discretion of the police chief, so it varies town by town.  In my town, forget about anything more than  target and sport  (carry to and from the gun club / hunting area only) unless you are Mr. Moneybags with Large Daily Deposits.  ( Your life is not worth shit, but your money -- now, that is important. )  In other towns, they treat law abiding citizens like adults.    Secret game hint: you never know when the rules will be changed -- a change  in police chief can throw a town from either side of the board to the other -- fun for the whole family!  Some chiefs will grant you a  personal protection  permit if you have been attacked or threatened.  Some other blue-suited assholes have been known to  count this as a NEGATIVE against applicants.  it is a crap shoot, and your rights are the stakes. --   cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\' Packet...
