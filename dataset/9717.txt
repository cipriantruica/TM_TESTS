Have a care with Phil.  We liked him a lot in Pittsburgh.  He did not score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his butt off.  It was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive zone that allowed the Pens to utilize his potential.  I have not been paying attention to him this year so I cannot say I know what you are  objecting to.  He has been out with injuries though, has not he?  And if the offense is not there, there is not much his speed will do for you. Like I said, he created opportunities but he did not score much.  I thought the money offered from the Rangers was a little high, and so did the Pens, I guess.
