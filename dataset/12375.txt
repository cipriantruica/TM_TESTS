(I presume you allready know there is a \'573 but that couldnt be the question, could it ? ;-)  During my student-trainee project, I discouvered a nice device, it is a PSD301   from Waferscale Integration. In one single (44 PLCC I think it was) package it contained: ROM, RAM, I/O lines and a programmable addressdecoder...  As far as I can recall, it can be hooked directly with a MCS-51 series uP ...  Neat huh ? But it needs programming before assembly, so it was not suitable for my project. Perhaps usefull for you (future) plans ?   Greetings!
