From: jks2x@holmes.acc.Virginia.EDU (Jason K. Schechner) Subject: ******** FOOT SWITCHES AND GUITAR ********   \ti have got 2 foot switches for sale.  They appear to be designed for studio use (ie: they are very well built) - 1  in diameter, 6\' cord.  i had like $15, but i had also like to sell them, so make me an offer.  \tAlso I just bought a new Ibanez guitar so I need to sell one of my others.  it is a Kramer with passive EMG pickups (2 single, one double).  These pickups sound GREAT and are whisper-quiet.  i had like to get $250 for it.  -Jason --  Settle down, raise a family join the PTA,  buy some sensible shoes, and a Chevrolet And party \'till you are broke and they drag you away. it is ok. \t\t\t\t\tAl Yankovic
