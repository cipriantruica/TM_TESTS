From: pierson@phakt.usc.edu (Harry Pierson) Subject: Embedded TrueType Fonts  OK...i have heard rumors about this...I might have even seen it in a few places. And i had like some info...Is it possible to embed fonts in a document (Like  Write, Word, or Ami Pro?) so the file can be printed on another machine that does not have the font?  If possible, how is it done?  i am sorry if this is a faq...I could not find a faq list...I would also  apreciate knowing where that is...if a windows faq exsists.  Thanks in advance   --  =============================================================================== Harry Pierson\t    |  Come and be with me, Live my twisted dream The Audio Mercenary |  Pro devoted pledge, Time for primal concrete sledge  pierson@usc.edu\t    |\t\t\t\t\t\t       -Pantera
