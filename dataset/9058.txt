I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered expendable by the A is when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance.  The A is brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque (that is a paraphrase of what I remember).  In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance, and the A is began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.    >Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, >so that i had never have to work again, i had restructure my entire swing.  Apparently, you sound like LaRussa.  >Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.  The A is also objected about this.   >If Canseco is open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back >problems, he shall be out of baseball in three years.

But possibly the cause and effect is the reverse of that.      --\tThe Beastmaster   --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com
