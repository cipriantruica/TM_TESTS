It is the  hypocrisy and claims the US did not help Iraq that make me angry, plus the fact that the USA seems to believe it has the *right* to interfere where is sees fit (i.e. has an interest) rather than a *duty* to intervene where it is required. This is demonstrated by the failure of the US to do anything about East Timor (and the region *is* becoming destabilised). The USA might have done something approaching the right thing, given my reservations about the uncessary number of civillian casualites, but for wholly the wrong reasons and after having a hand in creating the situation.  : That in no way would affect the US later military action against Iraq.  \tI did not suggest it would and it would be ridiculous to assert otherwise. I was simply indicating the USA has previously aided Iraq.  : Intel on manufacturing techniques, or something of that nature?   \tNo, apparently data (orginally from satellites although I doubt that Iraq would have been given the raw data) concerning troop concentrations.  \t\tAaron Turner\taaron@minster.york.ac.uk
