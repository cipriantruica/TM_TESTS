Oh I forgot the phase shifters.  It is kind of absurd, is not it?  Some players even want more distortion, especially the Hendrix fans :-)  But there are a lot of them out there that can only afford the amp, or who like playing music without distortion. Then there are your hard-core Hendirx fans that want particular *types* of distortion, i.e., they make it, not their amps.  >>Also, transistors have the advantage in both waste-heat and energy-use, >>mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes.  >Ah,  but how do they compare to Mechanical systems :-)  I did not see a thing about waste-heat from Babbage, and have not seen one of those mechanical TV is in a while, so it is anybodie is guess :-)  -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk     They communicated with the communists, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm   and pacified the pacifists. -TimBuk3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
