It is posted roughly every month or so by different persons, and that does not make it any better.  How did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded?  Why do not you consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the proper methods?  Besides, one can come to a conclusion without closing one is mind to other possibilities.  I you do not agree with a person, please ask him why he thinks like that, instead of insulting him.  Perhaps he has right.  Follow your own advice, be open-minded.  If you do not post a bit of evidence for your claims, i shall complain that it is always those  neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever  types who  narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives.  -- thomas kettenring, 3 dan, kaiserslautern, germany The extraterrestrials do not even know this planet has native inhabitants.
