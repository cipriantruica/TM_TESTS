I  _do_ know  that  IBM systems, the PS/2 56SLC2, in  particular, have absolutely no  problem  with  OS/2--never had  a  random  crash  while running any of  my programs under  OS/2.   In fact, I  do not  remember _ever_ crashing.  Of course, I really do not run any  OS/2 programs, just the  same bunch of DOS and Windows stuff that i have always been running.  And  when  I  had  the  56SLC  (this is  the  386SLC  system)  running Dos/Windows, I had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   FTP had a tendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from particularly fast  clients  (DTR is  150K-200K/sec), I  figured out the problem was with smartdrv is write buffering--if I turned off the write buffer, everything would work fine.  FTP under OS/2 has never locked,  though.  I can even format  floppies (to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.)  >\tFor instance, i am still wondering why print preview in a windowed >\tWP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.  Yeah, I guess i am willing to admit that OS/2  is somewhat sensitive to specific hardware.  WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2...  >\tPlease explain.

Well,  I save all  my  personal files to floppy,  and when  i did that under Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.  I  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal computation in the background.  >> and not being able to address your memory better than DOS,  >\tNot sure what you mean here.  The idea is  that OS/2 is DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows DOS  sessions.  I  let  XPL (a  shareware calculus program) see around 720KB of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me  do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS (where it would see around 610KB of conventional RAM.).  I  also found it really handy for my _own_ DOS-based programs, which, without  any re-writing, could now handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. Of course, the  point is  now moot,  since  the OS/2 programs I now write  simply _never_ run into memory limitations.  I never programmed  for Windows, so I do not have much of a comparison here, though....
