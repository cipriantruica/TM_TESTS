Suppose the text of the key is in itself conclusive evidence of the SAME CRIME for which the encrypted material is further evidence. I find myself envisaging a scenario like this:  You have made some scans of Peanuts strips. You encrypt them. The key is a phrase.  The Comic Police haul you in. They seize your system. They find the encrypted file.  CP:     Whats that file?   You:    I take the fifth.   CP:     what is the keyphrase to that file?    You:    I take the fifth.   Judge:  You have to reveal the keyphrase  [I disagree, but i am not a judge.]  You:    Your Honor, revealing the keyphrase, in it is own right, would  \ttend to incriminate me of breaking laws, independent of what  \tmay or may not be in the encrypted file.     Judge:  I grant you immunity from whatever may be learned from the key \titself   You:     The keyphrase is:  I confess to deliberately evading copyright;  \tthe file encoded with this keyphrase contains illegal scans of          copyrighted Peanuts strips.    Judge and CP:  Oh.        How will they get you now? i am not saying that they will not, or cannot (or even that they should not :-), but what legal mechanism will they use? Should we be crossposting this to misc.legal?  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeter Trei \t\t\t\t\t\t\tptrei@mitre.org
