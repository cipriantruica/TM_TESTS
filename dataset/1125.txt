From: zemcik@ls (Pavel Zemcik) Subject: Tseng ET4000 pixel clock  I would like to program Tseng ET4000 to nonstandard 1024x768 mode by switching to standard 1024x768 mode using BIOS and than changing some timing details (0x3D4 registers 0x00-0x1F) but I do not know how to select 36 MHz pixel clock I need. The BIOS function selects 40 MHz.  Is there anybody who knows where to obtain technical info about this. I am also interested in any other technical information about Tseng ET4000 and Trident 8900 and 9000 chipsets.  \t\t\tthanks very much  \t\t\t\t\t\tPavel Zemcik \t\t\t\t\t\tDept. of Comp.
