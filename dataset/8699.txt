National league pitchers are much better pitchers.   you are right: Thomas, Gonzalez, Sheffield, and Griffey do not even begin to compare with Ripken, Boggs, and Gwynn, so no wonder Alomar gets so much attention.  Sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was terrible.  So was his sophomore year.  National League pitchers are  much better pitchers ?  That certainly explains Sheffield is 1993, hm?  Are you confusing  have ERA is that are 0.40 lower because they do not face DH is  with  much better ? --  ted frank                 |  However Teel should have mentioned that though  thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |  his advice is legally sound, if you follow it  the u of c law school     |  you will probably wind up in jail.  standard disclaimers      |                    -- James Donald, in misc.legal
