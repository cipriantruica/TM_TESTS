Having lived, played, and worked on and near the Navajo reservation for a number of years, I can confirm this is an ancient pattern, found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old.  Also, the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they just stopped selling them after the Nazi is pre-empted the swastika.  Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and counter-clockwise swastikas.  Ob guns:  it is the rare Navaho family that does not own a rifle.  They remember being  relocated  by the US Army, and do not intend to do it again.  The Hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for weapons, from my experience.  Perhaps they just hide them better from strangers.  --  Kirk Hays - NRA Life, seventh generation.
