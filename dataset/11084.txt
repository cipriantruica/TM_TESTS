Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there is no such beast    as a  classified patent.   Patents exist to encourage communications and    develop the state of the art.   While there are not classified patents, there are  patent secrecy orders .  Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio, and apply for a patent. The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested, gives them a copy of your application, and you get a nice note back saying your patent application has now been classified for national security reasons and you are no longer allowed to make and sell it.   i am picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s. It was probably some analog scrambler, and would have probably violated FCC rules anyway, but it did get classified.  Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and then file a patent application.  Since it is been published, they cannot gain anything by classifying it, though you cannot get patents in most countries other than the US, where patent laws are different.  Obviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus  You cannot sell that widget, because there is a classified patent on it. you are not allowed to see the patent, or know who owns the design, so just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we will not throw you in jail for espionage.   Some countries might have that kind of system :-(, but we do not have that here.  Quite.  Yet. --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
