The 4xx have bundled software, modems, etc. \tBecause they have no  retail price  you might be able to get a steeper discount on them.  Shop around.  \tAs far as the monitors go, buy 3rd party.  Much cheaper.  Brett ________________________________________________________________________________ \t there is nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an intellectual conviction.
