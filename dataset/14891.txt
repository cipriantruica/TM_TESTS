Unfortunately, this is not true.  On another news group earlier this year, someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations. Very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV. The idea that the KJV is THE English Bible is more prevalent than many might think.    -- Scott at Brandeis  \t But God demonstrates His      The Lord bless you, and keep you; \t own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you, \t while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you; \t Christ died for us. \t       the Lord lift up His countenance on you, \t\t\t\t       and give you peace.  \t\t-- Romans 5:8 [NASB]\t\t-- Numbers 6:24-26 [NASB]
