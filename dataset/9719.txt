Dudley and Nielson are the only two coaches bad enough in the league to take talents like Mogilny and Kovalev and not know how to turn them into Bure and Selanne.  >as was predicted in preseason.

The trouble with the Rangers is that Neil Smith went out and got players like Messier, Kovalev, and Graves who have been schooled in taking the game to their opponent and attacking, while hiring coaches who are interested in  rope-a-dope  strategies.  If you want the Roger Nielsons of the world to be your coach you do not go out and get a Mark Messier, who is an old dog who cannot learn new tricks from a known loser, and you do not waste your draft picks on players like Kovalev.
