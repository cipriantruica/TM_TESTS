From: stlombo@eos.acm.rpi.edu (Steve J. Lombardi) Subject: Please help an Amiga user find comfort in Windows  By night i am an Amiga user. By day I work with windows. i had be much more  comfortable in windows if I had Two things.  1. A good Personal information manager. You know- a calendar, address book, reminder list etc... rolled into one clean interface.  2. A good file manager. Microsofts is very poor by my standards. How about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations  between them. being able to launch programs from the same interface would be nice. as well as text reading and graphics viewing. Those who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what i am looking for.  If anyone can steer me towards an FTP sight with these programs it would make my transition to windows a lot easier. Please reply via email as I rarely get to read this group. thanks so much! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _                     | why would he be such a jerk? i know that he does not smoke  steve lombardi      | drugs. and he does not do cocaine. and he does not shoot  stlombo@acm.rpi.edu | smack. and he does not even drink beer.
