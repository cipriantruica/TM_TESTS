They were acting in direct contradiction to scripture.  Jesus\' Second Coming is something that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be false Messiahs who will use His name.

The BD is contradicted scripture in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD is.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult, which was what they were.  Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a  supposedly devout Muslim?  I do not.  Saddam is just a dictator using the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.  God be with you,  Malcolm Lee   :)   |>  |> Kent |>  |> --- |> sandvik@newton.apple.com.
