Ownership is necessary to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the action was good or bad.  If neither you or I own a brick wall, then I cannot unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right, and you do not have the authority to declare that it is wrong.  The owner may find it artistic or she may be call the police.  (this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights)  it is vandalism because many people -- power companies -- do maliciously waste light.    maliciously  implies evil intent.  The lighting companies are not going out of their way to spoil the sky.  They just do not care.  >If they can sell you >or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes 30 to 50 percent >of its light, they make more _money_.  Never mind that your money is wasted.  It is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware. If that is what your city will buy, that is what the lighting company will sell. Write a letter to city hall.  Please note that i am not defending light pollution.  The orignial focus of  this thread was space based light sources.   --  Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu \t\t     Find a way or make one.  \t             -attributed to Hannibal
