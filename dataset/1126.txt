From: scott@osi.com (Scott Fleming) Subject: Sun IPX root window display - background picture   Hello netters!   I have a fairly weak question to ask everybody in netland.  i have looked though the last FAQ for comp.graphics but I did not find my answer.  Thus the post.   i shall keep it short.   QUESTION:  How do I display any raster files, gif files, iff or tiff images that I have on my  root window  or background?  I have a sun ipc, openwindows 3.0, Sun OS 4.1.3 if that helps any.   i have compiled POV for the sun and would like to display some of the work I have done as a background/tile.  Thanks for any help or information that you provide.  Have a good day.   Scott Fleming OSI   P.S. Kudo is to the people who provided POV, its great!
