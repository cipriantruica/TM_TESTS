All I said was that a right is whatever you or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights did not come into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly, the people); from that point it defined legal rights.   Common law  rights are vague and situational; that is why the people insisted on a Bill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what they demanded from the government.  Legitimate or illegitimate, power is power.  that is why the federal government can force states to grant their citizens rights they do not wish to: In a slugging match, the feds win.  Period.     And you are right, this does not belong in sci.space.  i have said my peace.  No more frome me on rights (at least not here).  >Most gracious regards,  >WHH   Doug Loss loss@husky.bloomu.edu
