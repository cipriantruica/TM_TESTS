From: balog@eniac.seas.upenn.edu (Eric J Balog) Subject: SWITCH 3.5  TO A:?  Hi!  i had like to switch my floppy drives so that my 3.5  b: drive becomes a:, while my 5.25  a: becomes b:. i am having a few problems, though.  I know that the ribbon cable must be switched, as well as the CMOS settings,  to reflect this change, and I think that i have done that correctly. However, the drives do not operate correctly in this configuration. From the C:> prompt, if  I type a:, the 5.25  drive light comes on; if I type b:, both the light for the 5.25  and 3.5  drives come on.  There are some jumpers on each drive: 5.25   Label   Original Pos.   Pos. I changed it to         DS0      ON               OFF \tDS1\t OFF\t\t  ON \tDS2\t ON\t\t  ON \tDS3\t OFF\t\t  OFF \tIO\t OFF\t\t  OFF \tMS1\t OFF\t\t  OFF \tD-R\t ON \t\t  ON \tMS2\t ON\t\t  ON \tFG\t OFF\t\t  OFF  3.5     DS0\t OFF\t\t  ON \tDS1\t ON\t\t  OFF \tDS2\t OFF\t\t  OFF \tDS3\t OFF\t\t  OFF \tMM\t ON\t\t  ON \tDC\t ON\t\t  ON \tMD\t OFF\t\t  OFF \tTTL/C-MO8 ON\t\t  ON   Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.  Eric Balog balog@eniac.seas.upenn.edu
