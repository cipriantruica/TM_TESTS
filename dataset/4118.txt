At least not for totally different lines of processors.  >While you are at it, where will the following fit into the list: >  68060 >  Pentium >  PowerPC  >And about clock speed:  Does doubling the clock speed double the >overall processor speed?  And fill in the __ is below: >  68030   __ MHz = 68040   __ MHz  At least for x86 systems doubling the clock speed increases performance by about 70% .  >Thanks very much.  i had appreciate hearing any further explanations >from any experienced folks out there, too!   >  >P.S.
