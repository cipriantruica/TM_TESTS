Can anybody help me out?  The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey does not allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:  Ctrl Anyq .  >In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says  For information >on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4... , this is so you >know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.

This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it is not true for menu accelerators.  If you are a Motif implementor, i had suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user is expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.  >Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?  If you mean  menu accelerator , no it is not possible.  that is according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.  >Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you >cannot use XtInstallAccelerators().

There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell is accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade \t\t\t\t\t  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton \t\t\t\t\t\t\t  - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = CtrlO   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = CtrlQ   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators =   n      CtrlO: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate) n      CtrlQ: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE is TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.  -- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)
