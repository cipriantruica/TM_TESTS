We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use in violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-set against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress a LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms. Contrary  to what you might think, time is probably on OUR side, not YOURS.  >This is the end. By the finish of the Clinton administration, your >RKBA will be null and void. Tough titty.   Yeah, right. do not hold your breath. My condolences on the discovery of uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands, but this has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  ... ridiculous tripe deleted ...   >The press is against you, the public (the voting public) is against >you, the flow of history is against you ... this is it !   Yeah, the liberal press does not like us much, but you cannot really expect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are based more on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (which are generously provided by the FBI, if they would bother to put on their Birkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friends are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They  would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They  support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly cannot accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly hurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different tune. They just better hope it is not too late then.  >Surrender your arms. Soon enough, officers will be around to collect >them. Resistance is useless. They will overwhelm you - one at a time.   Hmmm. I was not expecting company tonight. I might be able to whip up a quick cheese and cracker plate, but they should probably bring their own drinks. Do I have time to vacuum the rug?  >Too fucking bad.
