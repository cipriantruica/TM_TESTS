One consideration to remember is that if you do not turn it off now, you may not be able to later.  This is not a case of reaching over and flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly to execute a  turn off  command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can no longer be turned off. --  All work is one man is work.             | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
