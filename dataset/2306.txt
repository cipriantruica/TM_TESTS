From: don@hunan.rastek.com (Donald Owen Newbold) Subject: Re: ATM...  ==>  Now HPLJ 4 Pricing  While there are too many PS clones to count, some of which are quite poor, trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience. Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this.  Q:\tWhich version of Adobe PS will we clone? \tAside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released \tnew code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other \tsoftware vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure \tyou,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to \tdwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to \tmaintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.  Q:\tDo we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly? \tFrom the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had \ta number to call at HP or Adobe, they\'ld have heard from me.) Deciding \twhich approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.  Q:\tDo we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone is implementation? \tWithout a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe is \tPS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does \tleave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be \tnice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two \tdifferent implementations of Adobe is PS do not do the exact opposite given \tan identical set of conditions.  Q:\tPSCRIPT.DRV? \tHaving done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of \ttesting is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary \tsource we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files, \t(1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal, \tbut the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. i am sure that Adobe \tuses them too, but Adobe is output is by definition correct, even if its \twrong.  Yes, there are some very poor clones. we have seen them here at Rastek (a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor because the vendors do not know what PS is.  Don Newbold\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdon@rastek.com
