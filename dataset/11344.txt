Guess what?  we are doing something now you >cannot do in a Communist country or Nazi Germany.  we are complaining about >it, (or rather, you are complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.    We would like to keep it that way. Thats the point. By reacting strongly and forcefully now, we will assure that we continue to remain free. You cannot overreact to a threat like this. The worst that happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort. The worst that happens if we underreact is tyranny. I prefer overreaction myself.  >GUESS WHAT PEOPLE?  You live in one of the few countries in the world >where a person can complain without getting shot at.    does not that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is?  Only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom. I suggest that overreacting now and in the future is a good thing.  -- Perry Metzger\t\tpmetzger@shearson.com -- Laissez faire, laissez passer. Le monde va de lui meme.
