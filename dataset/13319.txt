In cats, the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat is feces.  The protozoa can cross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic after the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindness and mental retardation.  Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnant women should not scoop or change the cat is litterbox.  In addition, whoever does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling anything else, especially food.  Information came from _The Merck Manual, 15th Ed._  I hope this information is helpful to you.  Elisa picl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu
