I was late for a climbing meet one morning, so I got out of bed without bothering that my right foot was still asleep. It reminded me by folding underneath with a crunching of Metatarsals. Lucky the brake is on the right, but i got funny looks riding thru  London with one leg held aloft.  (Climbing wasnt a problem - the best splint in the world is a tight climbing shoe.)
