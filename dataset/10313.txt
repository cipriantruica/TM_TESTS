In fact, I would intimate that the offers >the Sharks got this year for Kisio were way greater than just a 3rd round pick.  Hindsight is 20-20. Nobody expected Kisio to have his 2nd best career year.  >>Besides, without Kisio, the Sharks would have tanked even earlier in >>the season, and Gund might have gotten a little more serious >>about getting Joe Murphy, a guy who definitely would be around >>3 - 5 years from now when the Sharks do make the playoffs. > >What else could be done?  The Gunds offered $2 million for Murphy, but the >Oilers wanted prospect(s), which the Sharks declined to give, which I think is >correct.  I did not mean to imply that Gund is offer was not enough.  Gund is offer was the right $, but too late in the season.  $2M offered in November lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the playoffs *this* year. $2M in March does not help Sather with his immediate objectives, does not help with long term objectives (only a prospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that). However, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to Chicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund panicks sooner in November. And here is another what-if twist: Chicago would have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the first place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in Chicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan all look like geniuses.  A broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston (and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you shiver does not it. :-)  Bottomline, for every black scenario any of you can concoct for Kisio leaving, I can concoct an equally bright one.  >>If the Kisio-fiasco was the cause of Ferierra is down fall, I hope >>it was not because he tried to trade Kisio, but because he screwed it >>up. Nonetheless, i am sorry Ferierra and Kingston are gone, and I wish Gund >>would follow. > >And what have the Gunds done exactly that caused you to wish that they were >gone? ...  Are you serious? \t- Let Ferierra go, \t- fire Kingston (these last two basically mean that \t\tSharks are starting over again in terms of the \t\ttimetable to capture the Cup. As i have stated \t\tfrequently: 5 out 6 expansion teams had the same GM \t\tfrom inception through Cup season)  \t- broadcast more home games than away games \t- broadcast very few road Pacific and Mountain time games \t- jack up my ticket prices from $27 to $38 in two years (not that i am \t\tgoing to pay 120 bucks for 3 seats. i shall probably next to the \t\tvirtual 107 folks)  \t- not tell me my priority   \t- not let me sell my priority   \t- in order for me to get the free jacket, force me to order my tickets \t\tfor next season before I get to select my section  \t- not let me park at the new arena after paying for their \t\tprivileged parking lot (which was sometimes full when \t\tI got there) for 2 straight years.  i have been a loyal ticket holder, since day 1 (literally) in spring of \'90 when the team was announced.  and i am not getting that loyalty returned. Wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison. And Pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all.  >GO EDMONTON OILERS!  Go for playoffs next year!  Stay in Edmonton!  I know one is not suppose to make negative comments on signatures, but what did us Oiler fans do to you to deserve the  Stay in Edmonton  part? i had never wish the Kings to leave metro-LA; it is too much fun watching the Shark is beat them. --  Mike Eisler, mre@Eng.Sun.Com  ``Not only are they [Leafs] the best team, but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburgh is.
