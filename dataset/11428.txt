Depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same key, it can be done.  For example, I was using  vat , which is an Internet Audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the session.  (Unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and did not have the CPU for it, so it did not sound all that good at a different site)  So, you do not neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge.  But if you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the conversation....  -derek   --   Derek Atkins, MIT \'93, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science      Secretary, MIT Student Information Processing Board (SIPB)            MIT Media Laboratory, Speech Research Group            warlord@MIT.EDU       PP-ASEL        N1NWH
