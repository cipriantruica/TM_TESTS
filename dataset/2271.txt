As part of a continuously downsizing Government organization, my code (branch) changes about once a year. I just finished changing the registration information using Norton Utilities. I sent the original requester the hex offset into USER.EXE containing the information, and his reply indicated he got several similar answers.  And it is not encoded in any way. As for the legality, there is nothing that keeps me from changing the information; it certainly does not reach out and alter the serial number printed on the inside of my manual.  -- Jim Moore  Panama City, FL
