From: ari@tahko.lpr.carel.fi (Ari Suutari) Subject: Any graphics packages available for AIX ?   \tDoes anybody know if there are any good 2d-graphics packages \tavailable for IBM RS/6000 & AIX ? i am looking for something \tlike DEC is GKS or Hewlett-Packards Starbase, both of which \thave reasonably good support for different output devices \tlike plotters, terminals, X etc.  \tI have tried also xgks from X11 distribution and IBM is implementation \tof Phigs. Both of them work but we require more output devices \tthan just X-windows.  \tOur salesman at IBM was not very familiar with graphics and \tI am not expecting for any good solutions from there.   \t\tAri  ---  \tAri Suutari\t\t\tari@carel.fi \tCarelcomp Oy \tLappeenranta \tFINLAND
