From: 18084TM@msu.edu (Tom) Subject: Level 5?   Nick Haines sez; >(given that i have heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in >maturity, I strongly doubt that this [having lots of bugs] is the case).  Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  i have never heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?  -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk      As the radius of vision increases, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm    the circumference of mystery grows. -------------------------------------------------------------------------
