True, which is why many of the newer keys ship out, oh, maybe 32 bits or so, have the key encrypt them, and return them to the PC.  Making a bunch of these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure things will not run without the key. :-)  Anyway, then, this scheme at least defeats your approach.  it is a little costly, though.  Personally, I do not believe in copy protection, and agree with the thought that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs the gains from what few pirates will not be able to copy the program.  \t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad
