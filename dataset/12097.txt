From: umlangston@msuvx1.memst.edu (Mark C. Langston) Subject: _negative_ logic high?    This may sound like a simple-minded question, but this is the first time i have ever had a need for this:  i have been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things like photoresistors (you know, no light to photoresistor, emit a logic high, etc.).  Anyway, i have got some servos lying around, and I wanted to do some things with them using digital logic.  I know all about having to pulse the signal and everything, I just have one problem:  i am assuming I need a negative (yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction  opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.  Is a negative logic high (i have seen this in schematics) the same thing as an active low, or what?  i am not using a bi-polar power source, so how would I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all three signals available:  Logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Also, please reply via email, as I never seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.  Thanks much, -mark  umlangston@memstvx1.memst.edu
