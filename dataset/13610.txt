Is there a single Titan III on order?  The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt to market it.  they are basically happy with their government business and do not want to have to learn how to sell commercially.  A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  they would need to go after multi-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketing task quite significantly.  They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time to get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had prevented launches from it for a year or so.  There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  So was that stranded Intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reached orbit properly. --  All work is one man is work.             | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
