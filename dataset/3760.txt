From: cr@cs.strath.ac.uk (Chris Reid) Subject: Quadra 700 memory upgrade   Hi folks,  \twhat exactly is the maximum memory I can put in a Quadra 700. My manual says 20MB (with 4 x 4MB SIMMs),  but MacWarehouse and the like advertise 16MB SIMMs to give it a total of 68MB. who has wrong? Has anybody got 68MB?   Thanks,   \tChris  __________________________________________________________________________ Chris Reid
