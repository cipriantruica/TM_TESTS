(do not forget that it worked in driving >out the US)  \tIsrael has repeatedly stated that it will leave when the Lebanese government shows that it can prevent attacks on Israel, and when the Syrians agree to leave.  \tThe Lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long, or maybe they are not capable of getting rid of the Syrians and Iranians who occupy their land.  If they closed down the Hezbolah, and negotiated a withdrawl of Syrian forces, Israel would be happy to leave.
