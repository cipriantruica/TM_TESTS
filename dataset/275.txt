Just curious, I guess. >  > cheers, > tom bruno   I am one of those people who always willl have unlimited stores of unfounded respect for people who have been on newsgroups/mailing lists longer than I have, so you certainly have my sympathy Tom.  I have only been semi-regularly posting (it is TOUGHto keep up) since this February, but I have been reading and following the threads since last August: my school is newsreader was down for months and our incompetent computing services never bothered to find a new feed site, so it was not accepting outgoing postings.  I do not think anyone keeps track of where other posters go: it is that old love \'em and leave \'em Internet for you again...   best regards,  ******************************************************************************** * Adam John Cooper\t\t Verily, often have I laughed at the weaklings * *\t\t\t\t   who thought themselves good simply because  * * acooper@macalstr.edu\t\t\t\tthey had no claws. \t       * ********************************************************************************
