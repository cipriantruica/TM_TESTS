Assuming that they are using >civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country?  So, it is okay to use civilians for cover if you are attacking soldiers in your country.  (Of course, many of those attacking claim that they are not Lebanese, so it is not their country.)  Got it.  I think.  Hmm.  This is confusing.  Could you perhaps repeat your rules explaining exactly when it is permissible to use civilians as shields?  Also please explain under what conditions it is permissible for soldiers to defend themselves. Also please explain the particular rules that make it okay for terrorists to launch missiles from Lebanon against Israeli civilians, but not okay for the Israelis to try to defend themselves against those missiles.  --  Alan H.
