From: estel@cs.vu.nl (Stel E) Subject: W32/TSENG card & other VLB cards... (please)   Hai,  In a few days i am going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses). It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard. It can do true-color but I do not know what type of card it is. I read that Cirrus Logic cards are not exactly the fastes around.  My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I consider buying a W32/TSENG card. i had like to know a few things:  \t- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2 \t  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example) \t- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it \t  support (text & graphics) \t- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM \t- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000 \t- Support in software  If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) i had like to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell me about it.   For the people in Holland: Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam!   Thanks in advance,\t\t\tErik Stel (estel@cs.vu.nl)
