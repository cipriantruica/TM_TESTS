You are admitting that your morals are situational.   You are admitting that the actions of other people and the situation you are in help to determine how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions.  If you employ X degree of force, that is not moral, but if you employ X degree of force, but previously someone else has employed Y degree of force, and the situation is thus-and-so, that *is* moral.  This is quite different from saying  Employing force on other people is immoral, period.   Unfortunately, from time to time we are obliged to do this immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation, and so we have to bear the moral consequences of that.  For what it is worth - and yes, I know you claim to be an agnostic - it is this ability to re-label things from  immoral  to  moral   that I find one of the *least* attractive qualities of the religious mind.  jon.
