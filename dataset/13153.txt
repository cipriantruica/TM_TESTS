Avoid things that would plug her up.  Crohn is has no dietary restriction in general.  In article , spenser@fudd.jsc.nasa.gov (S.

The current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.   Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.  > Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough > caveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.

Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are avoided because they may get stuck.  i had go ahead and have the fudge, though ;-)  .  > Discouraged greatly: > \to raw vegetables (too fibrous) > \to wheat and raw grain breads > \to exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it is apparently mostly water) > \to greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...) > \to little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby is without it!) > \to long grain and wild rice (husky) > \to beans (you shall generate enough gas alone without them!) > \to BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing >  > I was told that the more processed the food the better!

Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are  tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn is commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.  There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohn is.  And, as I always say when dealing with Crohn is, as does Spencer, Good Luck!  Steve Holland
