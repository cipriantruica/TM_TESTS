Interesting article, Craig.  it is amazing how hard it is to get baseball teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their customers.  No other business could ever get away with the 19th century  attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  I guess the owners look at baseball is high growth rate and ask why it is necessary to bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they do not realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans.
