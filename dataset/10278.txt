Fox was on Letterman about a year ago (or two) during the  playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the Bruins.  While he has not exactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie is legs (or something like that) in response to the Neely incident.  It was quite amusing, as one of the few Letterman viewers who actually knew what he was talking about.  Anybody know who the Pens celebrity hockey player is?  Michael Douglas (aka Michael Keaton)?
