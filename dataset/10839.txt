Just for the hell of it, let us destroy this remark. Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data. What the hell is he gonna do with it?  \t1) Trot around to the telco and say \'we would like an unauthorised decrypting tap\'. Uh huh. \t2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still do have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive Branch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they have got one? Goodness, wait \'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise. \t3) More likely, stare at the key, and say \'Oh, hell it is not worth all this bloody hassle\'  \tTruth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there.  \tThe only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:  \ta) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built in to the plan? \tb) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong encryption?   >But that is not really the issue.  The real issue is whether this  >will be used to justify a ban against individuals\' use of private  >(i.e., anything else) encryption methods.  \tThis is b), of course. I suspect not. If the government actually wanted to make such regs, they would just do it. A few hundred people on Usenet yelling about it would not even slow the machine down.  \tBesides, who is this mysterious \'they\' who has going to take away all our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gang of buffoons cannot even balance their checkbooks. The FBI? But.. they do not make the laws. The NSA? Ditto. The white house? Bill Clinton is probably still looking for the bathroom. it is a big place, after all.  \tAndrew  > >Al
