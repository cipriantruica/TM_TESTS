When one little country falls, its neighbor will surely follow, and before you know it, we are all mining salt in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings.  \tSurely the hypothesis relying on the least wild assumptions is to take this at face value. Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up something that is pretty secure, with a key that can be escrowed neatly, and they did. The government plans to sell this thing, for the reasons they state. Yes, those evil guys in the FBI can probably, with some effort, abuse the system. I got news for you, if the evil guys in the FBI decide they want to persecute you, they are gonna, and you are gonna hate it. Fact is, the FBI does not want to listen to your phone calls, and if they do, and if you are using triple-DES, they will just get a parabolic microphone and point it at your head.  \tThis is pretty clearly an effort by the government to do exactly what they are saying they are doing. As is typical with governments, it is mismanaged, and full of holes and compromises. As is typical with our government, it is not too bad, could be worse.  \tMy interpretation.  \tAndrew  >-Tim May, whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  \tis not this just a little melodramatic?
