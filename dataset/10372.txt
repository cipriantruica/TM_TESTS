From: matthew@wavefront.wti.com (Matt Coohill) Subject: ESPN f*ck up   \tOkay... here is some gripe ing  (?griping?... whatever).  \t(I live in Santa Barbara... for reference... I think)  \tOkay, ABC showed the Kings/Flames... fine... YAWN.  \tESPN (through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game) showed the   Red Wings/Toronto game... cool.  \tBut I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that   ESPN would show Pitt/NJ on Tuesday and Bos/Buff on Thursday.  \tI raced home from work early (4:30 Pacific) to catch the game, but   ALAS, it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would   show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday.  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind.  \tI did not mind THAT MUCH.  I watched the game (hockey is MUCH better   than NO hockey).  During the game their were no video highlights from the   Patrick division.  What the hell was going on?  At least they should show   video highlights of the other games (especially the NYI/Caps game that was   so close).  My father (lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky [Bumbf*ck, Egypt])   got to watch the Pens game on ESPN.  I just do not get it.  \tThe biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who did not want   to see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 2, will turn on their TVs on Thursday   and see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 3 instead of the Buffalo/Boston game   3.  At least, in my case, I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game.  \tIf I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on   Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN, i had be mad as   hell.  \tOh well... hopefully we will get better coverage next year OR   SOMETHING.  Matt Coohill  P.S.  The announcers for the Buffalo/Boston were the worst that I have \tever heard (as far emotion goes).  They had the enthusiasm of \t Droopy Dog .  I hope for better on Thursday.
