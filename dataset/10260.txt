HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO STAND IN >>FRONT OF THE NET, JUST NOT IN THE CREASE!  Yes, he does.  BUT, the goalie sure as hell does not want him there!  When I played roller hockey (boy do I miss those days) as a goalie, I would scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot.  I do not care if he has in the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball! (Yes, roller hockey, remember)  And if there was nobody around to clear the slot, then i had do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*.  I *hate* people in my way when i am the goalie, and I am sure Felix does too.  I should say that I did not see the incident, so if Potvin really swung the stick big time, then that is not right, but he can move people out of the way.  he has a player on the ice too, you know.  :-)  --     Keith Keller\t\t\t\tLET\'S GO RANGERS!!!!! \tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\t\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
