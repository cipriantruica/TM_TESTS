From: paladin@world.std.com (Thomas G Schlatter) Subject: Looking for Tom Haapanen  i am trying to find Tom Haapanen, formerly tom@wes.on.ca who was the keeper of the FAQ for this newsgroup. He was working at Watrerloo Engineering Software, but netfind cannot even find that (but it may have been a uucp connection).  If anyone knows how to contact Tom, please let me know.  Thanks, Tom Schlatter paladin@world.std.com
