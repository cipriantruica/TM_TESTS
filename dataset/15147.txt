From: erh0362@tesla.njit.edu Subject: Mormon beliefs about bastards       Could anyone enlighten me on how the Mormon church views  children born out of wedlock?  In particular i am interested to know if any  stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents.  i am especially  keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on  bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical  book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City.  If this is an issue on which the   official  position has changed over time, i am interested in learning both old  and new beliefs.  E-mail or posting is fine.  All information or pointers are  appreciated.
