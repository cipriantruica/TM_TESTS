We won the war, > hurrah hurrah!  The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that  hundreds of thousands  of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even  hundreds of thousands  of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs did not hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq is military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.  >  > OK, so some innocent people died.

How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I do not hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it is becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  that is war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it is one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago,  I know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!   War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.     >  >> The death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime,  but the legal >> shenanigans that have been added (automatic appeals, lengthy court >> battles, etc.) have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what >> it should be.

You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  i am sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we should not have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you had be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind do not understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and did not have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people is sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would have been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of  not guilty ? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one is guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         Regards,  Jim B.
