From: titus@ecosys.drdr.Virginia.EDU (Jason Titus) Subject: Virus? Centris 610 wierdness..  \ti have been getting seemingly random disk accesses on my Centris 610 with a Quantum 240 LPS, but this is NOT the regular recalibration it has been doing since I got it....  This is sometimes short, sometimes long, accesses that sound like there is some read/writing going on. \tI have SAM 3.5, and Disinfectant 3.0, but neither picks up anything.. Any ideas?  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tJason. \t\t\t\t\t\ttitus@ecosys.drdr.virginia.edu
