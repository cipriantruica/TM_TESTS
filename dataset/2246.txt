I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space. The limit that causes the message,  Windows will only use ...,  is the amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when Windows starts.  In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:  \tPageOverCommit=multiplier  The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:  \tThis entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of \tlinear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is \tcomputed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to \tthe nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value \tspecified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the \tamount of available linear address space, causing the size of data \tstructures to increase.  This also increases paging activity \tproportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a \tvalue between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry, \tyou must edit SYSTEM.INI.  -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories rnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com
