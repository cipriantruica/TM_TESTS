From: ejhupper@rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu (Eric Huppertz) Subject:  speed  LED is for a gateway motherboard   Hi,  I recently got a tower-case for my Gateway 486/33 file server, mostly because we needed the extra drive bays and better power supply.  This case has LED is for the processor speed, i.e. 33.  Is there a place to plug this in on the motherboard?  If not, is there anyway to hack something to make it work?  TIA!  -Eric  -  ()()    ()()  ()  ()()()    Eric J.
