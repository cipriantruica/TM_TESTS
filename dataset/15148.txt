Judge not that ye be not judged.   Strictly speaking, you are right - we cannot repent _for_ somebody else, for what they have done.  I guess I do not think it is out of line to talk about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation in  The sins of society  , or for our tacit approval (by our silence) of sinful attitudes or practices....it may be that we are also just plain begging for mercy, hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on our whole country for the sake of a few, much as Abraham sought to do for the sake of Lot.  (Hmmm, the results there were pretty cautionary...)  A few times lately when i have observed some either out-and-out sinful  activity, or just some self-destructive activity, i have gotten a strong impression that many folks really do not know any better.  Christ is pity on the crowds as being  like sheep without a shepherd  rings true to me. If these folks do not have a clue, do I bear _any_ responsibility for my not having communicated a better way?  Worse still; have I expressed  judgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any  positive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive?   I _know_ i have got something to repent about on that score.  Anyway, it is a real interesting question.   -- paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ ..........   .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . .  .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  .     .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .
