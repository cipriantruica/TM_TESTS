He rarely, if ever, makes it out of the division.  >>1-Canucks vs. 4-Jets                        Canucks in 5 > >>  Comment : it is more like Vancouver vs. Selanne.

Kings always seem to go at least 6 or 7, they never play a four or five game serious.  there is a difference between battling it out and pulling it out, as I take Calgary to pull it out in 7. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Robbie Po **          PGH PENGUINS!!!
