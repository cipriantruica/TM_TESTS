Okay, folks, I know i am in the minority on this issue, but I cannot let this assertion go unchallenged yet again.  i am going to say this ONLY ONCE, in the hopes of NOT starting a flame war off of the main topic.  Guns are offensive.  Cryptography is defensive.  See the difference? The only way you can use a gun is to hurt somebody else.  Crypto- graphy helps prevent other people from hurting you.  Sorry for the digression.  let us not forget the issue that we DO agree on: We want continued access to crypto technology of our choice, without key registration. -- George Mitchell (george@tessi.com)
