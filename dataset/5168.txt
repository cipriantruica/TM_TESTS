From: dcc@dcs.ed.ac.uk (David Crooke) Subject: Bitplaned ( non-chunky  pixel) cfb????  Is there a PD version of cfb, or other PD server stuff, which has a colour frame buffer implementation which works in bitplaned mode, i.e. where the screen memory is grouped so that  bit 0 of every pixel is here, bit 1 is there, etc.   The only such beast I know if at the moment is the GfxBase server for the Commodore Amiga, and it is commercial. I do not know if they wrote their own cfb, but I suspect they did.  Please respond by email, as I do not read this group.
