Give me a break! A little delayed, but in the interests of fairness (stats from Elias);         BA    OBP   SLG  R  HR RBI RNI  %   outs Alomar .310  .405  .427 105  8  76 264 20.5 419 Baerga .312  .354  .455  92 20 105 316 21.2 480  So we see that Baerga has a large advantage in RBI (runs batted in), RNI   (runners not driven in) and outs.   john rickert\trickert@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu
