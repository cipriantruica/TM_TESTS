From: mark.whalley@uk.co.gec-mrc (Mark Whalley) Subject: Windows Backgrounds  Help, i am bored with the current Windows backgrounds we have here and am  looking for some nifty pictures to use instead.  i have seen from previous posts that many sites exist that store pictures - available through anonymous ftp. Except that I cannot ftp to remote sites from my machine, what I CAN do is use \'ftpmail\' - mail a list of commands to a server and receive a mail of files,  and/or data back. Does anyone know of sites, with Windows compatible pictures, that can be  accessed in such a way???  If you do would you please post them. TIA    Mark.  PS. Maybe this would make a useful FAQ  |--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------| | mark.whalley@gec-mrc.co.uk           | \'Only in silence the word,           | | Phone  +44 245 473331 Exn. 3114      |  Only in darkness light,             | | The views expressed here are mine,   |  Only in dying life,                 | | all mine, and nothing whatsoever to  |  Bright the hawk is flight on the     | | do with GEC-MRC.                     |   empty sky\'  - Ursula K.
