As far as I know Dusseldorf has only one Canadian-German forward (i.e. a  player who was born in Canada but now has a German passport).  Benoit Doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play  for Germany in the WC.  The other Canada-born forwards are: \tPeter-John Lee (has British passport) \tChris Valentine \tDale Dercatch \tSteve Gootas  \tEarl Spry (?)  At the moment there are only three German-born forwards coming into my mind: \tBernd Trunschka, Andreas Brockmann, Ernst Koepf   Volker
