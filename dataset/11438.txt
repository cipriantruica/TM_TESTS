Read >Bamford is THE PUZZLE PALACE.  I did.  you are mistaken.  NSA is communications intelligence mission is strictly against foreign governments.  Here is an excerpt from the enabling charter (24 Oct 52, Truman) that should clarify this.  The charter was declassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public.  Mind you, I do not know that they never collect anything they are not supposed to... but spying on US citizens is not in their charter.      b. The COMINT  mission of the National  Security Agency \t(NSA) shall be to provide an effective,  unified organization \tand control of the communications  intelligence activities of \tthe United States  conducted against foreign  governments, to \tprovide for  integrated operational  policies and  procedures \tpertaining thereto.   As  used in  this directive,  the terms \t communications intelligence   or  COMINT  shall be construed \tto mean all  procedures and methods used in  the interception \tof communications  other  than foreign  press and  propaganda \tbroadcasts  and  the  obtaining  of   information  from  such \tcommunications by other  than intended recipients,  but shall \texclude censorship  and the  production and dissemination  of \tfinished intelligence.  they are also tasked with protecting the US is communications, but I have not seen the specific enabling memo on that.  I assume that is the role under which Skipjack was developed.  NSA is not in the standard-setting business, though -- that is why this Clipper stuff came from NIST, which I believe is tasked with coming up with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies, which would include NSA. --  \tJim Gillogly \tMersday, 4 Thrimidge S.R. 1993, 21:59
