From: 71554.1341 CompuServe.COM (DARLA) Subject: DeltaPoints Animated Desktop  Hiyas ALL,  Upon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend, I  could not wait to install it. I had gotten an advertisement for it and put  it aside  with my list of \'I Wants.\' After installing the software, it did not load.  No part of  the software would load even though the install went seemingly well.  \tI called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty  million different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of  the  systems that the software was \'incompatible with\'. Of course they are  willing to  give me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy.  The folks on their  support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings  of  Windows 3.1.  \tAfter my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I  learned  some of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop  Animator,  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of   .dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and >  100K the  other dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied   with Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll   to a  directory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll  in my  Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows system directory.)  When I did this, the animator is editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the  applications in the package.. the main application still did not load. Does  anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions   for trouble-shooting?                ____                   /     __                    Darla   |          /               _______|       .:|>     Portal: darla shell.portal.com                |  __/              darla cup.portal.com              |      __/               AOL: kuby2u aol.com     /  /           |                darlaiam aol.com    /  /__________               WIX: darla   |GENIE: KUBY        L_JJ            __JJ
