While i am sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious, that would not be because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. Modern,  ground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based telescopes. In any case, a bright point of light passing through the field does not ruin observations. If that were the case, the thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets might not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned, they are extremely bright.)
