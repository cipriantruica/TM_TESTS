How much data per >bit will be lost in average (I assume you still have the correct key)?  It depends on the mode you are using.  For a single 64-bit input block, a one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64 output bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into a random number.  If you are encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the one 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block, and all that follow it will be decrypted properly.  it is a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if corrupted bits are likely.     - Todd
