Good luck importing one--  They probably do not meet  US safety and pollution requirements.  There are mechanics and junkyards  which specialize in VW; they might be helpful for finding a  Thing  unless  the WWII re-enacters have grabbed them all.  The WWII Kubelwagen was the German equivalent of the Jeep, but was not 4- wheel drive.  One is on display at the Patton Museum at Fort Knox, Kentucky,  also the rare  Schwimwagen  (sp?) amphibious version, in full-scale dioramas. Highly recommended!  --  Frank     reid@ucs.indiana.edu
