From: rmoskal@panix.com (Robert Moskal) Subject: Volante Warp 10 board  i have been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection Faults on a 486-33, Eisa-VLB, system.  At this point I think i have narrowed the problem down to the video drivers for the Volante Warp-10 adapter by National Design, INc.  Yet somehow I find this hard to believe.  Does anyone else have any experiences with this board.  Thanx, Robert Moskal Brooklyn, USA
