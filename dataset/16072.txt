To me this was not only in poor taste, but it showed the media is bias and hostility to anyone not of the politically correct stripe.

Men have come close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage is whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from men.      -- Ayn Rand : \'Roark is speech from the _Fountainhead_\' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I do not speak for my company.
