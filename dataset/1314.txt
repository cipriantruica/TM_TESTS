From: renes@ecpdsharmony.cern.ch (Rene S. Dutch student) Subject: InterViews graphics package   Hello,  i am trying out the C++ graphics package InterViews. Besides the man pages on the classes, I have not got any documentation. Is there anything else around? Furthermore, can anyone send me a (small!) example program which shows how to use these classes together ? I would be very gratefull...
