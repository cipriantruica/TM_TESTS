From: mb4008@ehibm6.cen.uiuc.edu (Morgan J Bullard) Subject: Hard drive compression ie, stacker.superstor etc.   I was wondering if any one knew how the various hard drive compression utilities work.  My hard drive is getting full and I do not want to have to buy a new one.  What i am intrested in is speed ,ease of use, amount of compression, and any other aspect you think might be important as i have never use one of these things before. thanks  Morgan Bullard mb4008@coewl.cen.uiuc.edu \t\t\t\t\t\tor     mjbb@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu
