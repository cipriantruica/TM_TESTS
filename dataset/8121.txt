Rub it in, why do not you?   We have great weather and great roads here, unlike the rest of you putzes in the U.S.  Nyah, nyah, nyah.   \t:-) for the severely humor-impaired.  >This person is of a problem, but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go? >I want her to hold onto me  :-)   rather than the grab rail out back, and >i have heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we are >turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional >signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???  \tyou shall likely not notice her weight too much.  A piece of advice for you:  do not be abrupt with the throttle.  No wheelies, accelerate a wee bit more slowly than usual.  Consciously worry about spitting her off the back.  it is as much your job to keep her on the pillion as it is hers, and I guarantee she will be put off by the bike ripping out from under her when you whack it open.  Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time out too.  You and her need to learn each other is body English.  She needs to learn what your idea is about how to take the turn, and you need to learn her idea of  shit!  do not crash now!  so you do not work at cross purposes while leaned over.  You can work up to more aggressive riding over time.  \tA very important thing:  tell her to put her hand against the tank when you brake--this could save you some severely crushed cookies.
