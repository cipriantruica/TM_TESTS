From: wgw@netcom.com (William G. Wright) Subject: SE rom   \tI just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print  some grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are using an SE...even if you are running with an \'030 cpu. You will not see this in the printer is docs, and the Apple rep did not mention it to our users group either. It seems that SE ROMs will not support those  features . Okay, I  guess I should have somehow known that this was the case. Let the buyer beware, huh Apple? \tBe that as it may, I have been thinking about the  problem and i am puzzled. Why  cannot a defencieny in the  ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living (on unix platforms) and I do not understand the  it just cannot be done  responses i have gotten from those I have asked so far.  is not Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft- ware, just such a fix.  \tAnyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could someone armed with enough info and a little pro- gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the ROM is capabilities? \tAlso, how does one know if one is mac can support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300 is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer and trying it out like I did) \tThanks for your help.   Bill Wright wgw@netcom.com \t
