I seem to recall missing several key parts: \t\ta)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting \t\t  part comes out. \t\tb)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do \t\t  not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not? \t2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission \t  video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?  \t\ta)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups? \t\t\tThat hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are \t\t\ttwounits on the professional handhelds (so no \t\t\ttape turnover gaps)? \t\tb)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point \t\t\tfingers in either direction.  \tAs you well point out, Stephen.  > >\tAnyone (BATF, BD, X-BD, Other) could have touched it off, >\tby mistake or maliciously?  \tMore on this below.  > >\tOnce Koresh was shot...

If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF \thelps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.  \t\tThe reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely \t\tstraight on this is that the leaders at press conferences \t\thavew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that \t\tKoresh or his followers caused this.  \t\tThe BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations \t\tand morals ( not my fault, Koresh did it! ) than they \t\tare with:  \t\t\t25 dead children.  \tSame goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.  > > > >Painful point   > >       \tLA burned.

Besides the lessons. it is also time for many to grieve. >Including those who have lost their faith in others, or in God. > >i am learning to be patient, and let things heal. God willing.  \tSix years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be \tpatient.  For those who like contrary questions:  \tNB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law \tofficial hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same. \tThe official side has its advocates already; lets balance the \tequation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake \tof an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:  \t\tinnocent until proven guilty. \tnot \t\tinnocent until presumed guilty.  \t1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.  \t\tdo not tell me they do not exist.  They are standard \t\tequipment.  \t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?  \t\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This \t\t  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable \t\t  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.  \t\t\t.... gotcha!  \t\t  ... when in isolation from other substances.  \t\t  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote \t\t  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce  this window, \t\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come \t\t  down , and maintain a left to right sequence?  \t\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when \t\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace) \t\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to \t\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long \t\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend \t\t  to ignite.  \t\t\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics? \t\t\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?  \t\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation \t\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made \t\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature \t\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain \t\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length \t\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).  \t\t\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes. \t\t\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems), \t\t\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why \t\t\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open \t\t\tto the outside?).  \t\t\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the \t\t\tcompound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones \t\t\tare missing?  \tDo I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not. \tYou trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement? \t\tIN advance of a Court?  God help us. \t\t\t(For we are surely not helping ourselves). \tYou trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?  \t\tYou are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting. \t\tLook again.  \tDid it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there. \t\tAND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE. \tBut will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance \t\tto tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.  No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.  \tListen to your hearts, people.
