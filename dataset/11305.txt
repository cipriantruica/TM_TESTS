You should realize that form letters are the *worst* way to influence your congresscritters; exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest rung of the opinion ladder.  If you want to write (and I think you should!), take the time to really *write* a letter.  Things to emphasize:  \t- it is been said that Usenet is available to the \'technical \t  elite\', i.e. the techies at corporate sites and universi- \t  ties.  Emphasize that you are part of the group that will \t  be making/developing/using Clinton is  hadata superhighway.\'  \t- Explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing \t  and data communications. (if this is the case; do not call your- \t  self an \'expert\' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem.)   This \t  will distinguish your letter from the random flamers.  do not \t  turn it into braggadocio; just tell them that you know the \t  technical sides of the issue.  \t- do not overdo jargon and gobbledygook.  Remember, your letter \t  will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may \t  even be a college student; if they do not understand it, your \t  views will not even make the \'running total\' sheets.  \t- Be concise; do not ramble.  Rants are *definitely* out of place. \t  Cite references, if necessary, but only use  accepted  references \t  like academic journals.   My neighbor Jim  is *not* a real refer- \t  ence.  8)  \t- Unfortunately, very few Congresscritters *really* understand \t  electronic communications.  Encourage them to pick up access \t  to Compuserve, America Online, or one of the Free-Nets.  Offer \t  to send them samples.  If you are in a position to do so, offer \t  them (or their staffers back in the home state) access to your \t  systems.  Offer to give a demonstration the next time they are in \t  town.  Your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them \t  *will* give your opinions more credence.  \t- In addition to sending mail to your representatives, send mail \t  to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing \t  with the issue.  If your Congresscritter is not on the committee, \t  they cannot be of much help until the matter comes to the floor.  --Wes  ps> i had suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the     more traditional media, but Usenet does not have a decent track record     in the analogy department.  8)  --  Rachel Elizabeth Morgan  --  4/13/93, 7:00 am    | Oh yeah, I can be reached as 9 pounds 4 ounces (despite coming 3 weeks early) |     morgan@engr.uky.edu                                                  |----------------------------- To netters who gave constant encouragement and prayer - thanks for everything!
