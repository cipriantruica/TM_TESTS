From: alee@mnemosyne.cs.du.edu (Alec Lee) Subject: comm.drv replacement  There was a recent post about a BBS where you could download a replacement for comm.drv (Win 3.x) that fixed a lot of the problems with high-speed  modems.  Does anyone know of an ftp site where I can get it?  Thanks,  Alec Lee  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ |     Alec Lee          aslee@diana.cair.du.edu      (303) 871-5744   | |\t\t  \t     alee@cs.du.edu\t\t\t      | |---------------------------------------------------------------------| |\t\t  Sexy?
