As to whether the societal dregs he had for followers would be able to tell if he was a liar or not, not necessarily. Even if he died for what he believed in, this still makes him completely selfish.  Like us all.  So what is the difference.

There is no historical proof of this (see earlier threads).  Besides, he (or at least his name), have been the cause of enough deaths to make up for whatever healing he gave.   > \tNiether was he a lunatic.
