Come to think of it, it was only after I moved to Ames, Ia (pop 45K) that I ever took to locking my doors at night.  \ti have discovered that $50K/year is not worth living in fear all day.  I might just move back to the farm.  \tThis weekend is Veishea.  You know, when ISU students riot for no apparent reason.  This year, we have the Farm Aid concert to add to the festivities.  Anybody bet me there is another riot? Remember, Iowa law has three guys talking loud defined as a riot. Stay tuned for an on-the-scene report this weekend.
