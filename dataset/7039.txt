That reminds me of one of Texas is ads...you hear a guy speaking in French (like it is a letter home), then the French moves to the  background, and a French-accented voice come to the foreground, talking about how he went walking on the beach, and it felt so much like home that he decided to take his shoes off...and the rest of his clothes. It ended with  please send bail.  :-)  >On an rec.autos note, does anyone carry a gun on them or keep one in >their car (which is bad idea, is not it?) if you work in a bad part of >town (or regularly go through one)?  Is this a loaded question?  :^)  I normally have an unloaded Colt Delta in my glove box with a loaded magazine handy (which is perfectly legal in Oklahoma). For those times that i am travelling inter-state, I keep an unloaded  S&W .44 Magnum revolver in the glove box, with a speed-loader in my pocket (which is legal everywhere, under Federal law, Illinois State Police be hanged).  As i have said before, this is stricly for defense; my insurance will pay to replace my car, but I only have one life...  \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
