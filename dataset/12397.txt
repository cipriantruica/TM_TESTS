There are 3 types of warnings on (US) tapes:  \t1) A hologram is glued across the seam of the 2 halves of the \t   tape. The message usually reads,  If seal is broken, you must \t   buy this tape   \t2) The standard  MacroVision  warning,  Copies of this tape will \t   be unviewable   \t3) [your case] Extended message for the Average Consumer (tm) which \t   states that even attempting to copy the tape will destroy the \t   original. I do not believe you can sue them for misinformation \t   in cases like this :-)  \tTake care.  \tP.S. Of course,   is utter BS - but the Average Consumer (tm) \t     believes it. Heck, my mom once returned such a tape without \t     watching it... she was afraid that something might just  \t     happen :-) --  / Filip  i shall buy a vowel  Gieszczykiewicz. | Best e-mail  fmgst+@pitt.edu     | All ideas are mine but they can be yours for only $0.99 so respond NOW!!!! |  | I live for my EE major, winsurfing, programming, SCA, and assorted dreams. |   200MB Drive - Linux has 100MB and MS-DOS has 100MB.
