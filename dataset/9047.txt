From: moakler@romulus.rutgers.edu (bam!) Subject: The Bob Dylan Baseball Abstract   Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some interesting features.  This year, the predictions/team analyses for the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics.  I do not have the article in front of me, so i shall only give the memorable ones here that I remember and know the melody to.  I could dig up more if there is interest.  Yankess (to the tune of  Subterranean Homesick Blues )  Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine. George is on the pavement thinking \'bout the government. Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off, Says he has got a bad back, wants to get it laid off. Look out kids, it is somethin\' you did. do not know when, but it is Columbus again.  Mets (to the tune of  Like a Rolling Stone )  Once upon a time you played so fine you threw away Dykstra before his prime, did not you? People said  Beware Cone, he has bound to roam  But you thought they were just kidding you. You used to laugh about,  The Strawberry that was headin\' out. But now you do not talk so loud, Now you do not seem so proud, About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal....  Phillies (to the tune of  Highway 61 )  Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun, Just keep them off of Highway 61!  Giants (to the tune of  The Ballad of Rubin \'Hurricane\' Carter )  This is the story of the Magowan, The man St. Petersburg came to pan, For something that he never done, He sits in the owner is box but one... Day he could have been the Tampian of the world!  _______________________________________________________________________________ Bill Moakler\t\t |\tLPO 10280        |\t!RUTGERS ANIME! moakler@remus.rutgers.edu|      PO BOX 5064      |  !ATLANTIC ANIME ALLIANCE!
