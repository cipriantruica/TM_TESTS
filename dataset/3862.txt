I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the original ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for easier cleaning.  If the original poster has his answer, i shall ask: How do you open the new ergonomic mouse? By open, I mean split the two halves to get at the guts. It is not obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw heads.  Mark
