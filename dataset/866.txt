(6.0x is current.)  It allows you to view in 15 and 24 bit modes.  It really is QUITE nice.  Now, for a return question:  Do you run Windows?  If so, what are the dates on your drivers?  The newest ones *I* can find are from around 4-??-92!!  My problem is they conflict with Star Trek: After Dark, and other things as well.  i am willing to bet that it is the drivers, and NOT the programs.  Anyone out there have info on newer SS24 (NOT X) drivers for windows or OS/2?  Thanks, \tJustin
