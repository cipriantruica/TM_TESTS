Fred Rice answered this already in an early posting:  The problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is a _real_ believer and who may be  faking it .  This is something known only by the person him/herself (and God).  Your assumption that anyone who _claims_ to be a  believer  _is_ a  believer  is not necessarily true.   In other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and false Muslim. We are back to square one, Khomeini and Hussein are  still innocent and cannot be defined as evil or good Islamic  worshippers.  Cheers, Kent  --- sandvik@newton.apple.com.
