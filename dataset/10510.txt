The post (which, though having pretty much the same content, is an entirely different entity) was addressed to all.  When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will say  To: All .  I figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here.  that is an entirely  different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman.  Unfortunately...  >And I guess I let you know did not I?  >You do NOT represent a *large* body of hockey fans by any standard you care >to use to define  large .  65 people constitutes nothing more than a tiny  >group of fanatics and is in no way representative of  a large body of hockey >fans on the Internet  let alone of  one of the largest computer networks in  >the world.    The  largest computer networks in the world  phrase is a definition of  the Internet, not a group as a whole that she claims to represent.  As for the business of whether or not it is large, it is large compared to say, the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names, at least to this point.  And just for my own curiosity I thought i had look up the  official  definition of large in the dictionary.  It reads:  large - 1.  having more than usual power, capacity, or scope.             2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.  Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there,  thereby validating definition 2.  I would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large, which would give it a large scope.  >He might be impressed by the size of the list of names.  Why would he be impressed with this unless it were  large ?   I am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear yourself speak.    I personally do not know whether or not I agree with the letter.  I have very mixed emotions about it.  I like the names as they are, and do not think they make it that difficult to learn the game, but there might be a shred of validity to the change.    --  Paul W.
