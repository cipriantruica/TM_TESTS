From: meg5184@hertz.njit.edu (Starman) Subject: * what is the difference between a Mac Portable and Powerbook 100?  i have been looking into getting a portable Mac to do some work and i have had my eye on the PB 100. Lately, i have been seeing people with the old portables, and they are selling for $300 LESS that the PB 100s. What I want to know is: what are the differences between them? All I know is that the Portable is heavier, but the PB100 does not have an internal drive. Here is what I NEED to know:  Does the portable support Appletalk/network connections? what is the CPU inside a Portable? (68000?) DOES THE PORTABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM 7????????? what is the maximum memory capacity of the Portable? Can you still get \tRAM (meaning: does it use special SIMMS?) What kind of internal HD does it use? Does the Portable have a better screen?  \t\t\t\t\t\tTHANX in advance.  ===============================Mike Gaines============================== = WHAT is your name?
