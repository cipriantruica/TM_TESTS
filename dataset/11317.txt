This sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser, not a weakness in DES.  Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper that came out about 2.5 years ago, in both Computer Communications Review and Usenix.  For that matter, it was loudly discussed on the Kerberos mailing list even earlier.  The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES, and everything to do with bad password selection.  i am perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks possible on DES.  i am quite dubious that private research labs know them.  And the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite well established; see, for example, the Garon and Outerbridge paper in the July \'91 Cryptologia.  you are not going to do it in an hour with only ``rather powerful DES hardware\'\'.  i shall leave the arithmetic as an exercise for the reader.  On average, you shall need to do 2^55 trials. Pick your own parameters for how fast the DES engine runs, and for how many such engines are used.
