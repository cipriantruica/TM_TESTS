From: gt4417a@prism.gatech.EDU (SKELTON,JOEL PHILLIP) Subject: help me, i am not clever! (how to make power supply?)  I need to make a power supply that can take input from a  cigarette lighter in a car (12v dc) and drive 7.5 volts at up to 3.0 amps. I know enough to know that a simple voltage divider with two resistors will not do it right. Can such a thing be made from Radio-Shack-able parts without too much difficulty?  jps bf  p.s. i have looked for premade things like this at radio shack but none of it seems to go any higher than about 800mA.   --  Joel Skelton   --    North Avenue Trade School, Dept. of Round Things gt4417a@prism.gatech.edu   (ask for Scooter Technologies, and receive)
