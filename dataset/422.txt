That the US should not have supported Hussein and sold him arms to fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those who did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and it is a done deal. Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say,  Well, we sold him all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad for Kuwait.   No, unfortunately, sitting back and  letting things be  is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein is military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with your statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to sell arms to Hussein.  So it is really not the Gulf War you abhor so much, it was the U.S. is and the West is shortsightedness in selling arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable, right?  If so, then I agree.  [more deleted.] >  > mathew  Regards,  Jim B.
