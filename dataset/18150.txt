From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (The White House) Subject: CLINTON: AM Press Briefing by Dee Dee Myers 4.23.93                              THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary ___________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                  April 23, 1993                                PRESS BRIEFING                            BY DEE DEE MYERS                             The Briefing Room   10:35 A.M. EDT \t      \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  At 1:00 p.m., we are having a press  conference, Bill, in the East Room.  And then Saturday the President  will leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to Jamestown.  He  will spend the day there, overnight at Camp David.  \t      \t     On Sunday, it is unclear exactly what time he shall leave  Camp David and fly to Boston.  he shall leave from Hagerstown. The press  plane will leave from Washington.  \t      \t     He will meet with some -- \t      \t     Q\t  What kind of a plane is that he has taking? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  That he has taking?  he shall probably take a C- 20. \t      \t     Q\t  From Hagerstown? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  From Hagerstown.  Air Force One does not fly  out of Hagerstown, apparently. \t      \t     Q\t  How will the pool travel? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The pool will have to meet him ahead of  time.  So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait  for him at the airport.  There is currently no provision -- and i shall  double-check, because there is currently no provision -- I think  that is standard operating practice. \t      \t     Q\t  The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get  on the plane at Hagerstown? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe so. \t      \t     Q\t  What time does he have to be in Boston? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he has going to meet there with a group of  citizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at  around 1:30 p.m.  we are still working out the final times. \t      \t     Q\t  At the airport? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel.   \t     And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group  that authored something called Project 21.  The speech to the  publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m.  It will be followed by Q&A.  And  then after the speech and Q&A, he shall attend a reception with the  publishers, and then return to Washington from Boston.  And that is it  for the weekend. \t      \t     Q\t  Has the President seen the report from -- or the  letter, communication from the foreign service officers; also,  obviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright?  And what is  his reaction to their call on him? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, obviously, the letter was written to  Secretary Christopher.  I believe Secretary Christopher received the  letter on Saturday.  He reviewed it and met with the authors on  Monday to discuss their views.  He believes it is an important part of  the policy-making process and is taking their views into account as  we go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy. \t      \t     Q\t  What is the President is reaction? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not seen the letter.  It  was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher.  In  terms of -- he has not seen specifically the letter, but in terms of  their concerns generally, what the President has said is that there  are a lot of options on the table now, including ones that were not  there before.  And I think he has, as is everybody, gravely concerned  about the situation in Bosnia. \t      \t     Q\t  Is he influenced by that?  I mean, how does he feel  about the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk  officers -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Many of the specialists in that area -- I  think that that is clearly part of the process.  it is something --  their views will clearly be considered.  I think Secretary  Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views.  I  think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that  those opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who  work closely on the issues. \t      \t     Q\t  What do you mean, there are options on the table  that were not there before? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President said last week that  there were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian  Muslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being  considered. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine  Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action  by the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along.  Is that on the table? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I cannot discuss anything that would --  any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador  Albright and the President.  But I think the President has said he  would certainly -- is working with our European allies.  he has had a  number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build  some consensus there.   \t      \t     Q\t  Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything  specific to say today? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No.  I mean, in term of there will be no new  announcement of policy today. \t      \t     Q\t  Does your statement mean he has ruled out  unilateral action? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he has continuing to consult with our allies  at this point.  He has said -- I think he has been fairly clear about  it, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with  its allies on this. \t      \t     Q\t  On that point, does he believe that the U.S.,  though, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already  to take unilateral action? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes  it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian  relief effort.  I think the broader point is that anything we do, any  options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is  consistent with U.N. authority, and if it is not, we will work with our  allies to make sure that we get it. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as  distinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done  to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think that that is why we are considering  additional options.  I think that Mr. Wiesel is comments yesterday  were quite compelling.  The situation in Bosnia is tragic.  The  President is very concerned about it.  He has -- I think President  Clinton has worked very hard  to take further actions to continue to  isolate Serbia in the world community.  Clearly, we are considering  other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it is  not enough. \t      \t     Q\t  In terms of what you were just talking about, it  sounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to  protect humanitarian -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not think it -- I would not use the word  justify.  It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting  the delivery of humanitarian relief.  But I think that is just an  explanation of the resolution.  I think any action that we take will  be consistent with U.N. resolutions or we will work with our allies to  make sure that it is permissible or we will get further action. \t      \t     Q\t  The President and other officials have ruled out  unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past.  you are declining to do  that this morning. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, I said the President has said repeatedly  that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this. \t      \t     Q\t  That does not mean that he will not act alone, which  has been said before explicitly. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not mean to imply a change in policy.   The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with  our allies on this. \t      \t     Q\t  One other little question.  Did he know about this  letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe so.  Secretary Christopher  -- they may have had a private conversation about it.  The President  has not seen it. \t      \t     Q\t  They met on Monday, right?  Christopher met -- surely, he must have brought that up -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Again, they may have talked privately about  it, but -- \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what you are saying is that the Albright  recommendation has been rejected, is that correct? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, I did not say that at all.  I said I  will not -- I said I would not comment on any conversations or  communications. \t      \t     Q\t  she is advocating unilateral action and you are  saying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine  Albright may or may not have recommended. \t      \t     Q\t  Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and  frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue,  does the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service  officers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to  that? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think that their views are obviously being  considered.  The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two  days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing  of their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater  detail the options that they had presented in the letter. \t      \t     Q\t  does not it put some kind of pressure on -- additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to  act regardless of what the allies may or may not do? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think clearly there is a broad policy  review underway now.  And the President and his advisors are  considering a number of options, including some of those outlined in  the letter from the folks over at the State Department.  Now, no  decisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a  through review underway, and that their opinions are being very  seriously considered. \t      \t     Q\t  If I can just follow up, I guess what i am looking  for is what was his reaction to this letter?  Did he say, good, this  bolsters my position?  Or did he say, damn, this is just what I do not  need right now? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think he said this helps contribute  substantively to the debate.  it is important that all views be  considered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he  wants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and  this, I think in many ways, furthers that goal. \t      \t     Q\t  So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the  President -- it is all open now, and you would not take any umbrage or  say that they were out of line? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the fact that Secretary  Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they  had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is  conclusive evidence that their views are welcome. \t      \t     Q\t  Does the policy review include what Madeleine  Albright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested,  which is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral  action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table. \t      \t     Q\t  The unilateral option is on the table? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table. \t      \t     Q\t  we have had two different -- \t      \t     Q\t  is not that a change, Dee Dee? \t      \t     Q\t  That would be a change of policy. \t      \t     Q\t  Particularly if it includes ground troops, which  has been specifically ruled out. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has been -- well, no.   I do not -- that is not -- \t      \t     Q\t  Are you talking about all options? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  All options -- I think the President has  been fairly clear about that.  So let me just review again what he  has said.  He has said that -- the President has said all options are  on the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground  troops, which he has never suggested.  He has ruled that out from the  beginning. \t      \t     Q\t  has not he ruled out unilateral action of any sort? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He has said that he does not believe the U.S.  can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself.  I think  that there are a number of very complicated options on the table  right now.  I do not think that -- again, I do not want to comment on  specific options that are being considered other than in the broad  categories that we have already said -- things like lifting the arms  embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we have talked  about in broad terms.  This is a very complicated situation.  The  options being presented and considered are very complicated. \t      \t     Q\t  Air strikes on the table? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I think that is been fairly clearly  pointed out that that is something that is being discussed. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, are ground troops on the --  \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, ground troops are not being considered. \t      \t     Q\t  You said there was not going to be -- you said you  were not announcing a change of policy.  Then you said everything is  on the table.  we are confused.  Are unilateral actions on the table? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  All I can tell you is what the President has  said -- that he does not believe -- that he wants to act in concert  with the allies on this. \t      \t     Q\t  Wants to, but he has willing to -- I mean, if they  do not go along -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he has continuing to consult with our allies  on this.  he has continuing to have discussions.  he has continuing to  press them for further action.  And I think that is clear.  The  conversation is ongoing.  we are going to continue to work with them  to find the best possible solution and next step on this. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to  conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite  effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel  that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid  would become vulnerable and the Bosnians -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i am not sure that is the consistent -- I  mean, i am not sure who you are referring to. \t      \t     Q\t  The British and the French. \t      \t     Q\t  Yes, the British and French.  they have taken the  position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized  by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military.  Does the  U.S. believe differently from that? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had conversations with  both Mitterrand and Major, as you know.  I think that there is a  thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well.  And I  do not want to comment on the nature of the President is discussions  other than to say that he has continuing to consult with our allies as  we move forward and he has continuing to press them for further action.   And I think that process is ongoing. \t      \t     Q\t     the other day voted against any military  intervention yesterday.  Does the President regard that as the end of  the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of  unilateral action?  The allies have been very, very plain that they  do not want to do anything. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The consultations are ongoing.  that is all I  can tell you at this point. \t      \t     Q\t  Are you saying that there will not be any announcement  on Bosnia today in the press conference? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, that is not the intention of the press  conference. \t      \t     Q\t  What is the intention? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is an opportunity to take questions.  He  may have a brief -- i am sure he shall have a brief opening statement,  but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia.  That  will not happen. \t      \t     Q\t  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening  statement is? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is sort of a general statement of where we  are. \t      \t     Q\t  After the first hundred days, you mean? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is not a long statement.  I mean, this is  just generally.  do not look for any major policy pronouncements. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you know what the opening statement is? \t      \t     MS\n MYERS:  But it is -- perhaps later today i shall be able  to tell you with more certainty -- I think that is still under review.   But the overriding purpose of this -- it is not a mystery; it is not  meant to be.  it is just to take questions. \t      \t     Q\t  It would be helpful to know whether -- what the  opening statement is on. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Since the major purpose here is just to take  questions, it is not completely resolved yet. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and  that the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get,  would be an AIDS czar.  Will he announce that today?  And what is the  delay on that? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not think we meant to imply -- I think  we said it would happen soon.  I do not think we meant to imply with  any certainty that it would be this week.  It is coming soon.  I  do not anticipate that happening today. \t      \t     Q\t  what is the delay?  is not this the perfect time to  announce an AIDS czar? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not know that it is a delay.  I think the  process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through  the necessary background checks, and to make sure that we have crossed  the t is and dotted the i is before we make an announcement. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird is qualifications for  the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?  And why was not her  appointment announced here? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The qualifications -- I do not know if  there is a specific list; i shall have to check and see.  I think there  are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.   Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government  service.  I think there is a broad variety of views across political  spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there.  We never  made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board,  which is Admiral William Crowe. \t      \t     Q\t  Why would he appoint her, though, if the American  people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government  job? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe that the American people  ever had -- voted on her.  And I certainly -- she was never rejected  in the Senate.  She never went up there for a hearing.  But the  President believes she is a very competent person.  he has said that --  Zoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is?  Zoe Baird is on  the President is Foreign Intelligence -- \t      \t     Q\t  You said she never went up there for a hearing? \t      \t     Q\t  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage  over violating federal laws? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Right, she never -- she was never -- but you  said she was rejected by the Senate.  I was just simply trying to  point out that she was never voted on by the Senate. \t      \t     Q\t  So you do not think that is any problem? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not think there is any problem. \t      \t     Q\t  She has been appointed to this board, is that a  fact? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Yes. \t      \t     Q\t  Does she need confirmation for this?  Does she need  confirmation to be a member of the -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No.  it is a presidential appointment. \t      \t     Q\t  Usually, announcements are made here at the White  House.  Was there a decision not to announce her publicly? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  We did not make an announcement.  People who  asked were told who  the members of the board were.  We did not make  an official announcement.  If anybody is interested in that we can  certainly put out the list of names. \t      \t     Q\t  i had like to know. \t      \t     Q\t  do not such board members -- do not you normally as a   matter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and  presidential appointment regardless of their dimension? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Not always.  But, again, i am happy to put  this out. \t      \t     Q\t  is not that the standard practice? \t      \t     Q\t  That was past practice. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Again, i am happy to put it out.  we will put  out a list of the members of the board today. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, I do not want to try to fail to let you get  out of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is  has not it been the practice in this administration for such  announcements to be made routinely? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think generally but not always.  And we are  happy to put that out today. \t      \t     Q\t  What is the board, what is her title, what is the  size of the board? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  There is roughly a dozen members on the  board.  It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously,  retired military personnel on the board that provide input into  intelligence policy for the President.  Again, the chairman of that  board is Admiral William Crowe. \t      \t     Q\t  And did he recommend Baird? \t      \t     Q\t  what is the name of the board? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is the President is Foreign Intelligence  Advisory Board, PFIAB. \t      \t     Q\t  what is her qualification -- that she had employed  an illegal alien?  Is that -- (laughter) --  \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Do you want an answer to the question or you  just want to make a joke? \t      \t     Q\t  Let me phrase it another way.  Why should not this  appointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a  couple of months ago? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Because it is not.   \t      \t     Q\t  what is her experience in foreign intelligence? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  she is an experienced attorney, someone who  the President believes is very competent and qualified.  And I think  part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input.  Not  everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that  is not the board is mission.  It is to provide civilian input for the  President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters.  He  believes she is very qualified, very competent person, enormously  talented and has said that throughout. \t      \t     Q\t  Is this just a figment of my overactive  imagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the  President is Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not think so.  On December 24th, when he  announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he  would -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board.  So I  do not believe there is ever been any -- \t      \t     Q\t  Earlier than that, during the transition. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, I do not believe so.  It was announced,  again, on December 24th.  Admiral Crowe could not be there, but it was  announced.  \t      \t     Q\t  Are members paid? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe so, but i shall double-check. \t      \t     Q\t  On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the  discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the  bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state?  I guess it is the  Texas Ranger reports.   \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Most of the information is coming -- the  federal information is coming from the site.  Clearly, there is been  some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it.   Officials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day  before yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet  holes.  I think there is some discrepancy about that, and the Justice  Department is looking into it. \t      \t     Q\t  Is the President going to get involved in trying to  sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down  there, with some people withdrawing, others saying they are in charge,  but others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of  this? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not know that he has going to try to  mediate the dispute.  I mean, i shall let you know if there is anything  he intends to do about it.  But as you know, there are several levels  of investigation ongoing, and we are hopeful that they can work  together.  \t      \t     Q\t  Is there any one agency or official down there in  charge of everything? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not know.  i shall have to get back to you  on that. \t      \t     Q\t  What is the subject matter of Sunday is speech? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is going to be fairly general.  I do not  think it is going to be any specific announcements.  I think it is  going to be sort of a -- \t      \t     Q\t  Does he have a topic that he has going to talk about? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  we are still working on it.  But I would not  look for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like  that. \t      \t     Q\t  Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of  my  excellent adventure for 100 days ?  (Laughter.) \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Not exactly, but I think he shall take a little  bit broader look about what is happened in the last -- \t      \t     Q\t  Foreign, domestic? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  A little bit of both, but I think a lot of  domestic. \t      \t     Q\t  And overview.  \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, more of an overview than a specific  policy announcement.   \t     \t   \t     Q\t  Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which  the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  It will be a letter read to the crowd by  Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. \t      \t     Q\t  Is that available? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Not yet, but it will be.  Sure. \t      \t     Q\t  Are you going to put it out here or -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  we will probably put it out here on Sunday. \t      \t     Q\t  Travel next week? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Unclear. \t      \t     Q\t  What was the question? \t      \t     Q\t  Likely? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not -- \t      \t     Q\t  Likely?  Possible? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Possible. \t      \t     Q\t  what is possible? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Travel. \t      \t     Q\t  George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform  and national service legislative proposals next week.  Do you have  days yet for them? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Not yet. \t      \t     Q\t  Can you tell us which order? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Campaign finance reform first; national  service later in the week. \t      \t     Q\t  Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No. \t      \t     Q\t  And any report in the aftermath of the day? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Any readout from the day? \t      \t     Q\t  Readout. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is possible.  Jeff Eller will be down  there.  I think he can go through what the President did during the  day.  We do not expect any photo op or anything, other than departure  here in the morning. \t      \t     Q\t   Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular  practice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David.   In fact, he has been there -- what -- once or twice? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Twice. \t      \t     Q\t  Why this weekend? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He went two weekends ago, as you know, on  the way home from his father-in-law is funeral.  I think that they  found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend  some time together as a family.  And this is just an opportunity to  do the same. \t      \t     Q\t  there is no march there. \t      \t     Q\t  It has nothing to do with the march here? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No. \t      \t     Q\t  Since he has going to be in town Sunday morning now  instead of in Jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick  pass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he shall fly straight to Boston. \t      \t     Q\t  Flying straight did you say?  (Laughter.) \t      \t     Q\t  George took a question yesterday on Waco.  The  President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a  minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the  FBI.  And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and  whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas.  Do  you have an answer on that? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not.  i shall check. \t      \t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END10:59 A.M. EDT
