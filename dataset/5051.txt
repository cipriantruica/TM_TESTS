What  it may think is right  may be exactly what the user wants. Assuming that your application  has reason to know better  is, IMHO, anti-social.  If I start your application with a -geometry option are you going to ignore that as well?  there is really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything if it is managing your window.  You can ask, you can hint, but there is no guarantee that you are going to get what you want.  -- Tom LaStrange        toml@boulder.ParcPlace.COM
