I just do not understand why he remains so popular.  he shall take a piece of video of Clinton walking along; find a frame in which Clinton wrinkles his nose, say; freeze on it and blow it up full screen; and then rant for five minutes on how no one could possibly trust someone with such a face and such beady greedy little eyes.  i have seen this on his TV show (it was around the time of the inauguration).  Can anyone call this stuff legitimate (I hate to say  informed ) commentary?  How can anyone with half a brain in his or her head[1] continue to watch it[2]?  The American TV-watching (and I guess radio-listening) public never ceases to amaze me.  \t/J  [1] Oops, have I just inadvertently answered my own question?
