I do not have a history handy, but I do not recall that the preponderance of ROY is come from winning teams.  In fact, I think team performance is generally irrelevant, as almost always the most deserving candidate wins. Am I wrong?  And he is not necessarily on a losing team.  While the Angels\' staff is still very weak, their everyday lineup is doing quite well, thank you.  Snow is playing great.  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments. Easley appears fine, but even if he has not Flora is ready to come up. Between Gonzales and Gruber they will manage the hot corner.  Polonia and Curtis are steady and heady.  Even Myers and Orton are contributing.  Personally, I think they can finish over .500 which makes them a  winning team.     --\tThe Beastmaster    > >i am skeptical of the second because of his back.
