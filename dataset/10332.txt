From: rick@emma.tfbbs.wimsey.bc.ca (Rick Younie) Subject: stats for hockey pool  i am the keeper of the stats for a family hockey pool and i am looking for daily/weekly email servers for playoff stats.  i have connected with the servers at J.Militzok@skidmore.EDU and wilson@cs.ucf.edu.  i am still sorting these two out.  Are there others?  Email please as my site does not get this group.  Thanks.  Rick --  rick@emma.panam.wimsey.bc.ca  rick@emma.tfbbs.wimsey.bc.ca
