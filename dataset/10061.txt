From: sclark@epas.utoronto.ca (Susan Clark) Subject: Re: Bay area media (Wings-Leafs coverage)  \tYeah, the news is true...the Leafs lost to the Wings 6-3. Wish I could say i had seen the whole game but my husband wanted to watch  Young Guns II  on another channel. Sometime between the first time I tuned in and d saw the Leafs tie and the next time I tuned in and heard the score was 5-1, something happened. \tPlease no woofing from Red Wings fans.  they are my third favourite team, and if they make it past the Leafs i shall wish them luck.  As for Potvin...well, it WAS his fist playoff game.  Susan Carroll-Clark Who likes ANYONE Doug Gilmour plays for
