What I am saying is that Roussel can be a   netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records are similar.  And with that, I just do not see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.  You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh, the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.  > The same > for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a > great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If > you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But i am not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  i have seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  it is just my opinion, but I think he has got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So i am batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.  As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the save.  If he did not, it would not have mattered if the Rangers player did not get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that is what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him.  > But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie > stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a   goalie in action. Roussel > does not have a game like that in him.  I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you cannot tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are part of the game.  Or there would never be shutouts.  Anyway, i am happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and i am not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I do not want to piss you off to the point that you do not sell me any tickets next season:-).
