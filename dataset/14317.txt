It would have       to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to        conventional  Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching       by comets, it is got too many holes in it to count, but at       least it was a good try...     So you have a plausible model for GRB is at astronomical distances?  I do not have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-)     Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star    hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for    implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of    models.  Hmm, the  superbowl  burst has been claimed in press releases to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis, from what i have read (and I have not seen the papers, only the press) i had say it is consistent with some of the merging NS models     A paper on the possibility of GRB is in the Oort cloud just came    through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this     Here is the abstract of that paper.   ...       indicator to these events all possible sources which are       isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is       why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,       although there is no known mechanism for generating  GRBs       from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that  GRBs       originate in the solar cometary cloud       cannot be excluded until it is disproved.  This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no, anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference. that is ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known) are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...   *  Steinn Sigurdsson   \t\t\tLick Observatory      \t* *  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu\t\t standard disclaimer   \t* *  The laws of gravity are very,very strict\t\t\t* *  And you are just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*
