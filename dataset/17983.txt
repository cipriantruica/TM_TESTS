From: blh@uiboise.idbsu.edu (Broward L. Horne) Subject:   Only $17 / Month!      \tAhhh, remember the days of Yesterday?  When we were only  \tgoing to pay $17 / month?  \tWhen only 1.2% of the population would pay extra taxes?  \tRemember when a few of us predicted that it was not true?  :) \tRemember the Inaugural?   Dancing and Singing!  Liberation \tat last!    \tWell, figure *this* out:  \t5% VAT, estimated to raise $60-100 Billion per year ( on CNN ) \tWork it out, chum...  \t     $60,000,000,000  /  125,000,000 taxpayers = $480 / year          But, you exclaim,   i shall get FREE HEALTH CARE!   \tBut, I exclaim,   No, you will not!    \tThis is only for that poor 37 million who have none.  Not for \tYOU, chum. :)  That comes LATER.  \tAdd in the estimates of the energy tax costs - $300-500 / year  \tPlus, all that extra  corporate and rich  taxes that will  \ttrickle down, and what do you have?  \t$1,000 / year, just like I said two months ago.  \tAnd, the best part?   You do not GET ANYTHING for it.  \tDeficit is STILL projected to rise at same rate it is  been \trising at, by CLINTON\'S OWN ESTIMATES.  And this assumes that \this plan WILL WORK!  \tI mean, come on, it does not take a ROCKET SCIENTIST to see \tthat in another 2 or 3 years, we are GETTING ANOTHER WHOPPING \tTAX INCREASE, because the deficit will STILL be GROWING  \tFASTER THAN the ECONOMY.  \tAll Clinton is doing, is moving us to a HIGHER diving board.          Face it.  Clinton is Bush X 2.  In four more years, our \tcountry will be completely bankrupt, and your children is \tfuture, so oft mentioned by Pal Bill, will be gone.  \tAnd those of you still deluding yourselves will be faced \twith the guilt.  \tWell, , gotta go.  I want to be out of \there by noon.  Got an appointment at the lake.  No tax \tthere, yet.  \t:)
