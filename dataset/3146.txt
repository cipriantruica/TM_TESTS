From: junaid@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au (Mr A. Walker) Subject: 2 Sound Blasters in 1 machine  \tIs it possible to have 2 Sound Blasters in 1 machine? Would give your the equivalent of a SB Pro but with stereo Digitized sound. The way Creative Labs price Pro is in Oz, the price is equal.  \tI suppose you could set the I/O addresses to 220 and 240H but what about the DMA channels? \tAny way what is this DMA channel sharing hype?  Does it share the SB and hardisk DMA channels or something more esoteric?
