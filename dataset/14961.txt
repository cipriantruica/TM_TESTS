If He  was doing his own will, what kind of example is that?  Should we follow it?  -When He says he has to return to the Father, who is He going to?  -When He says he does this in order that the Comforter, the Holy Spirit might  come, who might that be?  -If He claims that the coming of the Holy Spirit is such a blessing that it is  worth His leaving us and returning to the Father, what can that mean if there  is no Holy Spirit?  -Why does not the best known Christian prayer begin  Our Saviour, who art in  heaven,  rather than  Our Father?   Do they have answers to these questions that are even plausible?

I believe  Jesus only  originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  i am not the right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be several, including what would classically be called monophysite or Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who will not use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply because it is not Biblical.  --clh]
