You may not think that it is fair, but how many sins do you know of that affect only the sinner?  Is it fair for us even to be able to get into Heaven?  Do we have a _right_ to Heaven, even if we were to lead sinless lives?  Anyway, your argument seems to be saying,  If _I_ were God, I certainly would not do things that way; therefore, God does not do things that way.   \tIsaiah 55:8-9:  \t For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my \tways, saith the LORD.  For as the heavens are higher than the \tearth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts \tthan your thoughts.      Original Sin is biblical:  \tRomans 5:12-14:  \t Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death \tby sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have \tsinned: (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not \timputed when there is no law.  Nevertheless death reigned from \tAdam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the \tsimilitude of Adam is transgression, who is the figure of him \tthat was to come.   \t1 Corinthians 15:22:  \t For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made \talive.   -\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t- Steve Creps, Indiana University creps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu
