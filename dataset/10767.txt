Nice to think, but naive.  The fact is that millions of people today are sending highly confidential information over unencoded, easy to receive cellular phones.  They figure the chances of being heard are small, so they risk it.  And 99.9% of people do not understand crypto the way the least of the sci.crypt newbies does.   If Clinton tells them it is good crypto, they will believe him, and send important stuff over it, and be thankful that they are no longer using clear-voice FM cellular phones.  Only a tiny fraction of people will want more crypto.  Worse, in the eyes of the government, which swears up and down the algorithim is spook-level secure (and it may indeed be) the only reason you could possibly want this extra level is to avoid police.  By using it, you shall attract attention as a likely lawbreaker.   Your honour, the suspect suddenly started using another level of cryptography and we cannot tap his phone calls any more.  He must have something to hide.  Please sign the warrant to search his house...  --  Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366
