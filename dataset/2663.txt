From: louray@seas.gwu.edu (Michael Panayiotakis) Subject: help: object appears thrice!   Hey all...I got an equation editor, and since it did not automagically appear in my  object  dialog box (i.e. insert-->object-->equation), I decided to manually place it there.  So I went into win.ini (is there another way to do this?), the [embedding] section, and added   equation=equation,equation,,picture.  did not work. quit windows, go back.  AHA: mistake. Correct it.  It looks fine. start windows...does not work.  play with it for a while, at one point having two entries to see if one works and th\'other do not, and finally I get it to work.  The only thing I can see that is different now is that it is now the first item on the list, and it used to be the last.  But now I end up with *three*  equation  entried, and *all* of them working. (and only one entry in win.ini).  so does any netian know what is wrong? or rather, how to correct this? (i.e. make  equation appear but once?).  Also, all the entries in the [embedding] appear as above. it is obvious that  is the executable, or whatever, and  picture  has something to do withthe way it appears (picture/description?)  but what are the others? i.e., in  soundrec=sound,sound, whate is the difference between the 1st  sound  and the 2nd?   and what is  soundrec ?? (I do not think it is the name of the executable, as other entries (e.g. MSWorksChart=...) are not)  thanks, i.a.
