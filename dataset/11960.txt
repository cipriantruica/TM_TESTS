They are selling it for about $3.50...   Digi-Key also sells Quad Line Receivers, parts DS1489AN (68cents) and DS1489N (48cents).  A Quad Line Driver, part DS1488 (48cents), is also sold.  I guess if you do not will not to supply +12V, the chips with the pump-up circuitry might be worth the extra cost.  But 1488 is and 1489 is are available at your friendly neighborhood RS, parts MC1488 (276-2520) for $1.29 and MC1489 (276-2521) for $1.29.   Jeff White          jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu
