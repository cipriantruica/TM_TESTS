From: lars@cs.sun.ac.za (Lars Michael) Subject: jpeg fif specification    I recently got a document describing the JPEG FIF (JFIF) file format. I was looking thru it, but I did not get the idea how to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the whole image.  How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF?  How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale picture?  I wrote a small tool (lsgif) for GIF that returns the filesize, picture size and color resolution by analizing the header chunks. The output looks like this:    157605  bla.gif                                  640x 480  248C24  I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a similar tool for JFIF, with an output like this:     57605  bla.jpg                                  640x 480     C24  Please respond by email, because I do not read this news group very often. i shall post a summary if it is useful.  Thanx in advance, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLarry  +-------------------------------------+------------------------------+ |    Lars  Larry  Michael (Mr. GIF)   |  If Murphy is Law             | |          lars@itu.sun.ac.za         |      can go wrong, it will.  | | lsmichae@informatik.uni-erlangen.de +--------------+---------------+ | Spec.
