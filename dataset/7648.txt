From: maven@eskimo.com (Norman Hamer) Subject: Re: A Miracle in California  Re: Waving...  I must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers while riding does a lot of good things to my mood... While riding is a lot of fun by itself, there is something really special about having someone say to you  Hey, it is a great day for a ride... is not it wonderful that we can spend some time on the road on days like this...  with a gesture.  Was sunny today for the first time in a week, took my bike out for a spin down to the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about 20 other people who were down there for similar reasons (there is this GREAT stretch of road on the way down there... no side streets, lotsa leaning bends... ;) ... Went on an impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who  I did not know, but who were my kinda people nonetheless.  As a fellow commented to me while I was admiring his bike...  Hey, it is not what you ride, it is that you ride... As long as it has 2 wheels and an engine it is the same thing...  --  ---- maven@eskimo.com (InterNet)         maven@mavenry.altcit.eskimo.com (UseNet) The Maven@The Mavenry (AlterNet)
