I have a lot of fonts that I can install either as Type-1 PostScript (under ATM) or as TrueType.  I have noticed that:      1.\tTrueType font files are at least 1/3 larger than their Type-1 \tequivalents.  If you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware \tthat TrueType fonts will compress, whereas Type-1 fonts will not \t(they are encrypted).      2.\tWith a 300 dpi laser printer, the  artificial bold  version of a \tTrueType font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to \tinstall the actual bold (and bold-italic, etc.) variants if I want \tto use them.  Type-1 PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually \tdistinct bold variant from the base font.  I realize that the \tartificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior \tto the hand-generated bold TrueType variant, but it is sufficient \tfor my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me 50% \ton disk space (uncompressed).  -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories rnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com
