From Captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict obedience to the Gensis command to subdue the earth, to Nazi is who have  justly  punished the Jews for the killing Christ (as well as the other progroms), the innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with  you shall not allow a witch to live , the Moslems who were killed in the Crusades, the god-fearing men destroyed by the inquistion.  The religious wars in Spain, France, England, etc.  Christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the instructions therein, was unquestionable.  There is much to grieve.  randy
