For a little more practicality and more comfort, the Nissan 300ZX Turbo is a good buy.  And for a good dose of luxury, the Lexus SC300 is perfect (with a manual transmission of course.)  However, the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like it is looks, the performance is supposed to be great, almost race car like.  I do not particulary like the Mitsubishi 3000GT is or the Dodge Stealths as they are too heavy and are not very nimble handlers for a sports car. --  A motion picture major at the Brooks Institute of Photography, CA Santa Barbara and a foreign student from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
