Even the country you live in,USA, have condemned \tArmenia for it is attacking. And you start to say that the attackers \tare the Azeris?????  \t \t|>Armenians have lived in Nagorno Karabakh ever since there were Armenians  \t????? \tAzeris have lived in Nagorno Karabakh ever since there were Azeris... \tdo not come with nonsence, there is no reason to attack a people \tjust because a man called  Gorbatjov and co.  gave the  freedom  to the people \tin this area.   |>If I recall correctly, it was Stalin who caused all this problem with land |>in the first place, not the Armenians.  \t  \tit is easy for people like you to blame history. The were a lot of          Indians living in USA. There is no reason for these  \tIndians to attack the  American  \tpeople and say: It was the fault of the government of Germany and Great  \tBritain, because they made people come to our place......  Armenians lived in \tharmony with the Azeris until  Gorbatjov and co.  gave  freedom  to the people \tin Karabag, then the Armenians started to kill, rape and torture the Azeris, not only \tin Karabag but also noe in Azerbadjan....  |>henrik]  However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane |>henrik]  to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one |>henrik]  that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane |>henrik]  (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.    |>HE]     do not speak about things you do not know: 8 U.S. Cargo planes |>HE]     were heading to Armenia.

The content of |>HE]     of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not |>HE]     humanitarian aid.....   |>What story are you talking about?

I would not like to guess about what were in |>the 3 planes in your story, I would like to find out.    |>HE]     Search Turkish planes? You do not know what you are talking about. |>HE]     Turkey is government has announced that it is giving weapons |>HE]     to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan |>HE]     it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons |>HE]     since it is content is announced to be weapons?  \t|>it is too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia.\t  \t\t \t  that is what i do not want, you could not imagine the result of a war..... \t  So France, Greece and  USA wants to start fighting with Azerbadjan????  \t  They give a lot more weapons to the Armenians without  \t  saying it, that is no secret any more......   \t  I must say that these Armenian Government is very shortsighted. \t  Do they think that they shall move from it is neigbours when the war  \t  is over???? The neighbour around will be there and Armenia must \t  \t  live in harmony with these if they do not want a  stone-age  country, \t  for that is what is will happen Armenia if the wars continues. \t \t  Look, The President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, died and  Petrosyan \t  the Armenian Presindent is now in Turkey for the funeral. Is it because \t  he liked him? Sure NOT, because Armenia needs it is neighbours and must \t  live with these. But Armenia cannot stop this war with continued ordertaking \t  from states like France and USA. With other words, if you love your people \t  you must think twice.....  \t  And i wonder,  Shoot down turkish planes  WITH WHAT????? ohhh i forgot \t  the Armenians cannot find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned \t  countries.....
