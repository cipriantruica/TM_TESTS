Why do not you contribute to a group >helping the homeless if you so concerned?  I do (did) contribute to the ARF mortgage fund but when interest rates plumetted, I just paid it off.  The problem is, I could not convince Congress to move my home to  a nicer location on Federal land.  BTW, even though the building is alleged to be funded by tax exempt private funds, the maintainence and operating costs will be borne by  taxpayers forever.  Would anyone like to guess how much that will come to and tell us why this point is never mentioned?  js
