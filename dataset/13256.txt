From: jge@cs.unc.edu (John Eyles) Subject: tick fever (aka rocky mtn spotted)  Any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there ?  The doctor thinks a friend might have this. The question is, does not the tick have to bite you ?  You frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk in the woods around here, but you tend to notice it before it bites you; pulling one out of your skin is something you are not likely to forget.  Can you get the fever without it biting you ?  Do they sometimes bite you and then let go so you do not realize you were bitten ?  I know they will let go once they have had their fill, but you certainly would notice this (arggh).  So how do you get the fever if you never pulled a tick off yourself (as opposed to finding one merely crawling on you) ?  John Eyles jge@cs.unc.edu
