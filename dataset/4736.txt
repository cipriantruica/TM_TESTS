From: karenb@westford.ccur.com (Karen Bircsak) Subject: lost in (TekHVC color) space  (please respond via email!)  Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  i am not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O\'Reilly is ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.  The O\'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me).  The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you cannot actually edit any colors.  We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  i have poked around  in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have  no idea what is going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the  above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail  for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have.  Any hints?  Please respond with email as I do not regularly read this group.
