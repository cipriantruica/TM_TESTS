But with Slaught and Tom Prince, they did not want to lose Prince in order to bring up that 11th pitcher.  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and Prince is coming along nicely!        do not feel too bad for him.  he has still gonna get theat $4,000,000 over the next two years -- he shall be able to do most of what he wants to do.  -- /*****************************************************************************/ /* Jon `Iain` Boone   Network Systems Administrator     boone@psc.edu        */ /* iain+@cmu.edu      Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center  (412) 268-6959       */ /* I do not speak for anyone other than myself, unless otherwise stated!!!!!! */ /*****************************************************************************/
