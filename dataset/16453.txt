Or claims to have discovered so...  It would hardly be the first time they raided someone based on incorrect evidence.  > Was it a \'no-knock?\' I really have not heard anything on that. But clearly  It was a  no-knock , according to the Associated Press report. Here is something I found in my collection:      Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final     Edition Monday, March 1, 1993 (the byline is associated press):      WACO, Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100     law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed     religious cult.  At least four federal agents and two cult members     were reported killed.  [...]      The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock     trailers stormed the sect is head-quarters Sunday morning,              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and     explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in     Washington.  [...]      Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound is main home,     throwing concussion grenades and screaming  Come out,  while three     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no     response.  Then the shooting began.   I think  storming the sect is head-quaters  and  throwing concussion grenades  qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).  > he was not just another guy minding his own business.
