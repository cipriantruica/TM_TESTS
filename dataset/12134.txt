I do not \t\t       know the number of the line.  And I do not want \t\t       to call up the operator to place a trace on it.  \t   Question:   Is there a certain device out there that I can \t\t       use to find out the number to the line? \t   Thanks for any response. \t\t\t\t\t\t       Al   -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Bore\t\t\t\t\t |  Life is Short...Code Hard  jbore@Shearson.COM | ...!uunet!shearson.com!jbore|  (212)464-3431, Beeper:  (212)396-4248\t\t |
