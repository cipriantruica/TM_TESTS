From: gilham@csl.sri.com (Fred Gilham) Subject: Poem             The Sophomore           (Romans 1:22)  The sophomore says, ``What is truth?\'\' and turns to bask in the admiration of his peers.  How modern how daring how liberating How modern how daring how liberating they chant  The sophomore, being American does not know That his ``question\'\'     modern        skeptical            cynical  Was asked before, by a     modern        skeptical            cynical    urbane cosmopolitan  Politician (appointed not elected) Who happened to live two thousand years ago.  Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm\' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He did not like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.\'\'  But when they mentioned `King\' and `Caesar\' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     he had start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     he had piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She did not tell him anything    He had not already figured out.  So he punted.  ``Not my jurisdiction!  Take him to see Herod!\'\' (who just happened to be in town....)  Herod appreciated the courtesy But was not worried         And sent the sharp-tongued fool      (Who suddenly did not have much to say,     funny how people lose it under pressure....)   back In the attire proper   to his Royal State.  His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly will not.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it is not Caesar is.  ``i am letting him go,\'\' he said with a shout. (Looks like he shall last this one out....)  The crowd is reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They did not want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we will get Barabbas next time.  And if I can get them to say    ``We have no king but Caesar!\'\'    By killing a madman, Hell, i shall kill ten a day.  And then Pilate had his fun   A little joke     Short       To the point         Trilingual  And all this Went as it always does When someone gets caught In the gears of government  And there is a scientific explanation      (no doubt) For the superstitious rumors      (persisting to this day) That it did not all end With a tomb and a Roman squadron on guard.  Our sophomore does not know about this He does not recognize his kindred spirit (Or truth either, as he admits).  I guess we have not learned much in two thousand years.     -- -Fred Gilham    gilham@csl.sri.com  Peace is only better than war when it is not hell too.
