From: dchan@cisco.com (Derek Chan) Subject: service indicator of a BMW   Does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a BMW after changing the oil yourself?  Also, I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five yellow service indicators went out. That means I do not need oil service until it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which does not make sense to me. Any idea?  PS of cause I did my first oil change at 1,200 miles    Derek
