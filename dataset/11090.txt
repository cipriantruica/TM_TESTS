From: rlglende@netcom.com (Robert Lewis Glendenning) Subject: Re: Organized Lobbying for Cryptography  Generally, an organization has influence in proportion to:  \tThe narrowness of its objectives \tThe number of members \tThe strength of belief of its members  This is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives, lots of interested members who are real passionate.  For this reason, mixing with the NRA is probably a bad idea.  It diffuses the interests of both groups.  It may well diminish the Passion Index of the combined organization.  It is not clear it would greatly enlarge the NRA.  So, I believe a new organization, which may cooperate with NRA where the two organization is interest coincide, is the optimum strategy.  lew --  Lew Glendenning\t\trlglende@netcom.com  Perspective is worth 80 IQ points. \tNiels Bohr (or somebody like that).
