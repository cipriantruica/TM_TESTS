This means that the CPU does not sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other computing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking OS, that is.

What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone >   know how they perform?  Why do not you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence, IDE *is* ISA, on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it is specs are the same as ISA - 8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec.  This is why i have concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast slot.  The card is job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA speed.  Heck, that is what ISA slots do - i shall just use one of those instead. --  Richard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.com OS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...
