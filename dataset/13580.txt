The soak part greatly increases the inconvenience.  do not bother unless it does not work otherwise.  >The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the >vaseline properly.   Exactly, but it adds to the  ritual  aspect, which is important for us suggestible patients.  (Posters, do not bother to repeat the  rationale for the soak.)  >If it is not done right, you remain greasy and stick  Greasy no matter what. Vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is  famous for that.  One text states that the more greasy a dry-skin cream is, the more effective.    >Try it. it is got to be cheaper then spending $30 for 8 oz. of \'natural\' >lotion.  Try USP lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  USP lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (do not buy the more expensive perfumed lanolin mixture).  As i have commented before, petrolatum is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in biological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close, even on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there for months or more, and have associations with cancer.  do not panic, but also do not believe it is God is gift to the human skin.
