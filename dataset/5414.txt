From: stellr@smyrna.cc.vt.edu (Ray Stell) Subject: Prereq: public-patch-0    --  In the R5 file fix-01 there is the line that reads as the subject line here.  I do not see a file fix-00.  When I got a few Hmmm... lines putting on fix-01, it made me wonder if I has missed 00. Am I off the mark?  Thank you.   ====================================================================== Ray Stell\t\tstellr@smyrna.cc.vt.edu\t\t(703) 231-4109  They call Stephen the first martyr.   had not Lazarus the rawer deal? - C.
