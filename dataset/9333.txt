Nor would he.  If, however, I were on Manny Lee is team,  >Again.  If Manny Lee was on your team last year your team would not have been >the Albuquerque Leftturns.  It would have been the Toronto Blue Jays.  How is that possible?  He was on the Albuquerque Leftturns last year. How could you possibly know what team he would be on if Manny Lee was on his team last year.  After all, Manny Lee was not on his team last year, so it is complete, unfounded speculation to state that if he was on the same team as Manny Lee last year, it would have been the team of the Toronto Blue Jays.  Since he and Lee were not on the same team, you cannot possibly objectively state what team they would have been on if they had both been on the same team.  Greg
