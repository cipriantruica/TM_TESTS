From: wam3090@yak.COM (Bill Massena) Subject: Function key to text string translation   \tI want to press a function key and have a text string appear in an XmText widget.  When I put  \t*XmText.Translations:    n  \t\tF1:  insert-string(HELLO)  in my resource file, the translation does not happen.  If I put  \t*XmText.Translations: F1:  insert-string(HELLO)  in the file, I get the text string HELLO when F1 is pressed, but no other  keys work, which makes sense since the default translation mode is  replace .    \tDo I have a syntax problem here, or something deeper?  ..Bill Massena (wam3090@yak.boeing.com)
