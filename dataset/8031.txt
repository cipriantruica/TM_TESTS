From: vech@Ra.MsState.Edu (Craig A. Vechorik) Subject: Re: More MOA stuff --- like the RA  From what i have seen in my 17 years as an MOA member, most of the folks in the RA are also in the MOA... I guess it is called covering all the bases to get some idea of what is really happening.. How else does one think the RA gets all the juicey news about what is happen\' inside the  MOA?  Nihilism is not for everyone, not that it really matters!
