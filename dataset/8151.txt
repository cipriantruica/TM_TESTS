Well it still looks like you have got an attitude problem Mr. Muttonhead.  You should take the comments with more sensitivity.  I still despise most people who belittle drinking and driving since my first girlfriend was killed  by such an asshole back in \'85.  Learn to take the verbal  abuse.  If you cannot take the flames,  and you cannot use your brains, stay out of the newsgroup.   ============================================================================= = The Beav |Mike Beavington|BellNorthernResearch Ottawa,Ont,Canada| Dod:9733= = Seca 400->Seca 400->RZ350->Seca750->Suzuki550->Seca650turbo->V65Sabre     = = (-> 1994 GTS1000 ...cannot afford the \'93) |  mbeaving@bnr.ca              = = This company has no idea what I am talking about!                         = =============================================================================
