This is a tautological statement.      I think you are confusing  tautological  with  false and misleading.     No, but you are right that I did not express myself well.    The dialog went:     A:  Zionism is racism.     B:  What IS zionism?    DC:  You were not listening, were you?     In other words, the first statement *defined* a Zionism of discourse.   Everything else was redundant.  --- D. C.
