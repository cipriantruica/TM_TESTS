For an expansion team?  i am pretty sure I would go with the rings, as long as their salaries and ages were not too high.  I would want the fans to be  able to identify the players.  I would like a championship attitude in the  clubhouse.  As for Larkin and Griffin?  Salaries aside, I would have to consider which player is likeliest to contribute to a WS victory.  Past performance, age and attitude would all be integral to my decision.  I certainly would not just haul out my copy of Gillete and pick Larkin, as many others would.  And, unlike many others who post to this group, I hardly consider myself quali- fied to make those kinds of decisions.  >    (I cannot believe i am getting involved in this... :)  I have never been able to believe it about myself, to tell you the truth. it is like banging your head against a stone wall.  --   cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca                                              So many morons... rm                                                   ...and so little time.
