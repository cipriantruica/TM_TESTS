Personally, I think Jeffy-Poo was still smarting more from the third degree burns he suffered after April 1st last year rather than the supposed burns that he suffered in  the joke .  Granted I was one of those people that were taken in by it and I was certainly concerned...and then pissed at him for  pulling such a thing (which I made known to him).  But then again, for an April Fool  joke  I would also go on record as saying that it was the best orchestrated one i have ever seen and it certainly sucked a LOT of people into believing it 8-( 8-| 8-  8-)...   sick  -  twisted ??? Who in this group could ever be accused of such a thing?  I tip my twisted lid to thee Jeffy 8-).
