What i have been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior. That is, it does not take much work to be moral, but it certainly does to be immoral (in some cases).  Also, i have said that morality is a remnant of evolution.  Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in the animal kingdom.  >>So you are basically saying that you think a  moral  is an undefinable >>term, and that  moral systems  do not exist?

But, this does not get us anywhere.  Your particular beliefs are irrelevant unless you can share them or discuss them...  keith
