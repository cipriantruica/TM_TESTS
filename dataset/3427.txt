From: ins132g@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au (Nicola Brown) Subject: Programming the Beeper!  \tI need to be able to cause a beep, but without using any interrupt routines, as I cannot use the BIOS. I believe that the PIC might have something to do with it, but i am having troubles deciphering the information I have on it to figure out how to program it!  \ti am programming all of this in Turbo C, if that makes any diference at all...  \tPlease can anyone help me??!  Thanks, \t \tNicola
