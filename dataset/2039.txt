Only a sucker believes \tan MS released survey results about an MS product.  Ok--assume \tthat the results of the survey, whatever they are, are 100% \thonest.  If the results indicated extreme dissatisfaction with \tthe product, is MS going to tell us to stop buying MS-DOS 6.0 \tbecause it sux? :-)  Sure....  > *** Would it not be fair to say that the relatively few people who have decided > to purchase 6 would be inclined to like it.

As I just said, you have \tseen what automakers do.  Who is going to believe Chrysler if \tthey tell us,  In a \'random\' Chrysler-conducted survey...  \tMy theory about certain people is that they are convinced that \tif a point is maintained long enough, it is true.  After all, \twhat is the focus of this company?  Information.  Money and \tinformation.  Technology is, for some, an expedient toward \tthese ends.  Why did Bill Gates drop out of college?   \tWas it because he could not afford it at the time?  Was it \tbecause (as the WSJ says) he could not wait to use what he \tknew to go out and make money?  Bill Gate is answer to this \tquestion would be highly interesting.  I await it. \tI cannot stomach Bill declaring himself a visionary and \tusing every available opportunity to build up the cult \taround himself and then having MS sell DOS and Windoze \tas their main stays.      --------------------------------------------- |kenton+@CMU.EDU | OS/2 FIXES BROKEN WINDOWS |  ---------------------------------------------
