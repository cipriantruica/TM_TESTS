Roger, Your responses might just exclude you from sharing your opinions, then.  You see, the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHL are the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down like wheat at harvest-time.  She never said she represented the entire internet or the entire group rec.sport.hockey.  She has every right to state her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty or hundred-odd folk who have agreed to allow her to list their names on the bottom of it.  You may not agree with it.  Fine.  I really do not care enough about the name change to care.  Your name is not attached to it, so why moan and complain?  If you felt her words were leading, well, you are free to feel that way and take exception, but manners never hurt.  I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine (I have the right to think and say that, too).  Ali is under no compunction to change a single word.  Now, while you are free to disagree with every word she wrote, to tear apart her character is uncalled for.  i am posting this as a form of public reprimand.  If you tear down Ali is integrity and character publicly, you shall get chastised publicly in return.  Would it have been so hard to say,  Ali, please be a bit more specific in your description, the way i have read it indicates you are stating my view also, and that is simply not true. i had really like to see a disclaimer noting that you do not mean the entire internet or the entire r.s.h. group attached to it, despite your intent to list names at the bottom.  Thanks.  Cordially as always,  &c.  Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the weight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of myself, and possibly others.    Oh, and Ali, nice to see someone standing up for something, even if it is not something I personally advocate.  :-)        --  Valerie Hammerl \t       John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab  hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside, V085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.   I wanted to learn how to  get that feeling, and the only way was to learn how to skate.   P. LaFontaine
