[ ..see previous article on this debate for the rests.. ]  I can see XV-3.00 agree with my view in cases you do not -- even I say my personal opinion (as above), it does not mean that it is not most obvious thing. Please, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument, please do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just refered to text from which I wrote  isomething\' -- and you make hard decisions from that, without reading what exactly I have written.  It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method and do not understand include previously written material with the new sentences to give them meaning. You seem to be one such.  You also start replying to my articles, even you do not understand what is going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were wrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply to. Believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know that you have not read my article carefully in the first place.  XV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the places you did not; i am sure you just did not undertand what about I wrote. We can blame my writing skills (in English?) for that, or?  Better stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV-3.00 gives; I allready mailed one to Bradley...   Juhana Kouhia
