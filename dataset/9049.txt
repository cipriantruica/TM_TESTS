Anyway, the worst pitcher on the Yanks. If you mean currently on the team, then I have to go with Scott  i am a schizophrenic...No, i am NOT!  Kamienicki. Sure, occasionally the guy can pitch well for 5 or 6 innings, but then he starts to go insane. A sure sign that he has losing his stuff (and his mind) is when he starts to stalk around the mound between batters and yell at himself.  The worst all-time Yanks pitcher?  Gotta go with Ed  New York? I have to pitch in [gulp] New York?  Whitson. \'Nuff said!   --i am outta here like Vladimir! -Alan Sepinwall XVIII  =========================================================================== |  what is this?  This is ice.
