As a provider of a public BBS service - are not you bound by law to gurantee       intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes       with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition       for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)  The US does not yet have many laws covering BBSs - they are not common carriers, they are not phone companies, they are just private machines or services operated by businesses.  there is no obligation to keep records. As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant, you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists, and they generally can confiscate the equipment as  evidence  (which is not Constitutionally valid, but we are only beginning to develop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compel you to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password for the disk - there are not any definitive cases yet, since it is a new situation, and there probably are not laws specifically covering it. But the court cannot force you to *know* the keys, and there are no laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys for their own files without giving them to you.  Even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty. There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law, so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew. The US does not have laws forcing you to keep your records in English, and these were the originals of the records.  HE did not speak Hebrew, and neither did anybody in the court organization.  do not think they were able to do much about it.  It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers based on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference; it probably has not been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible extension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.   --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
