From: kiran@village.com (Kiran Wagle) Subject: Replacing internal FDHD w/ floptical?  Hi all,    I have a IIsi with a floppy drive that might be bad (and might just be out of alignment, I have not checked yet. :-))  If the drive is not easily reparable, i had like to replace it with an _internal_ floptical.  Can this be easily done?  Can it be done at all?    i am assuming that floptical drives can read and write both 800k and 1.4k floppies.  If this is not in fact true, please tell me.  Thanks in advance,         ~ Kiran
