It requires no extra cabling.  I had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to heat.  The FanCard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no longer appears.  it is supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range of 75-95 degrees Fahrenheit.  According to the maker is (M.S. Tech) advertisements, the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running (w/o a/c) in Desert Storm.  I cannot vouch for that.  However, I am a satisfied customer.  And I have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order house (Lyben  (313) 268-8100).
