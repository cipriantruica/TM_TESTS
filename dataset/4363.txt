They realised that spending two years on numbercrunching the finite stress analysis figures for the complex injection-molded cases was not the way to go, and was holding up development work. Especially when the first FEA model for the portable left out the battery cover, and it had to be redone. that is why the portable was about three years late.  Designing metal cases is easier - they are managing with the Calculator DA, now it can compute 45/100-0.45 correctly.  Any other suggestions?  L.
