Yeah, and at least one person ran back in. SOunds like a personal choice to me. Religious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the  hadefense\' of your beliefs, is probably at the core of what happened in Waco. We in the west tend to disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups who see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefs/convictions. I suspect that this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs. BUt we will probably never know...  Karl
