From: jfreund@taquito.engr.ucdavis.edu (Jason Freund) Subject: Info on Medical Imaging systems   \tHi,   \tIs anyone into medical imaging?  I have a good ray tracing background, and i am interested in that field.  Could you point me to some sources?  Or better yet, if you have any experience, do you want to talk about what is going on or what you are working on?  Thanks, Jason Freund
