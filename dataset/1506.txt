If you read the last couple of books in the series closely (well,   and   at least), there are at least two points at which the real Question is implied.  Conversations proceed much like:  Zaphod: What *is* the ultimate Question, I wonder? Arthur (not paying much attention to Zaphod, but needing a random seed for   the Infinite Improbability Drive): Think of a number, any number.  Actually, it may be Marvin who uses this phrase a few times as well, and everytime it is arranged such that  Think of a number, any number  could be an answer to someone is question about the Question.  I kind of like it.  Very mystifying.  it is not even  pick a number  or  tell me a number , just  think of one .   --  Kevin Martin sigma@rahul.net  Use the flipper!
