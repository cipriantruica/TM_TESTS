From: Joe Eddy Demers  Subject: BIOS timer interrupts  Hello,     i am trying to use the BIOS timer interrupts (which occur every .055 seconds, or 18.2 times a second) to time people is response times, in a psychology experiment, and the response times are on the order of .01 seconds. Is there any way I can get better precision than by counting ticks? Or can I make the ticks occur more frequently? i am trying to do this in DOS 5.0 on a 386, and it would be nice if this could also work on our old 8086 machines running DOS 2.1 (I know, I know, I do not like them any more than you do) but this is by no means a requirement, just a possibility.      So, basically, any information on the BIOS tick scheme and the related inrterruots would be appreciated, as well as any information on alternate ways of improving accuracy. Email is preferred, as i am planning on posting this to a few boards, and I do not read all of them. Thanks  Joe
