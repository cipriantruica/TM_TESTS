Canada is saturated by American media.  While pundits come on cable and talk about how awful our health care is supposed to be, what people experience up north ends up not differing from what they see portrayed on American television in movies (i.e., same infrastructure, different insurance make-up).  Yet they know not of any insurance problems, and have no idea of what an HMO is ... but having lots of British TV as well, they know that they do not like NHS.  >Someone must have a reason to argue against it, valid or not-what  >kind of people are they?  The polls that you refer to, for the Canadian data, are from the annual July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world is top poll researchers, and Mulroney is Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations.  The American polls are Harris polls, and have been reposted on USENET a few times and probably will again. i am sorta suspicious myself, \'cos maybe Americans want universal coverage like Canada --- I honestly doubt that most Americans realize that we have private doctors and public and private hospitals (i.e., similiar health care infrastructure) and our  system  is basically pure insurance without HMO is.  >>Given recent turnarounds by the HIAA (endorsing universal coverage) >>and hostility to corporatist HMO is within the AMA, and the complete >>silence vis a vis Canada-bashing by the AMA, I suspect that they are >>keeping the  secret  about Canada up their sleeve. > >Exactly. would not you?  Until the idea of managed competition arose, there was no direct threat to stand-alone private practice.  In the 1960 is, the AMA fought HMO is as corporatized socialist medicine ... part of the reason why we have only insurance, and no HMO is in Canada \'cos that was part of the deal cut with the CMA.  >>>i have also read that the three biggest American HMOs can be compared >>>straight up against some of the smaller Canadian provinces (in the >>>Maritimes) and they spend something like $300-500 less per patient. >>>Maybe it does help. >>  >>The American HMO is can still  cream  and they probably cover a smaller >>geographic area than even our smallest provinces.  Geography, again. > >Some of them are spread out across the whole country, I think.  But each site is probably compact, and the clientele are creamed. And do not forget that HMO is place caps on your coverage, and often will not tell you about additional procedures you could get otherwise (despite that you might be willing to pay for it).  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.
