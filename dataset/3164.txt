NS16450, NS16C450, NS16C451, NS16550AF, NS16C551, and >NS16C552.  no argument on going direct to National (see my previous post on this topic), but some info regarding what you said above.  I do not know about the 8250 or 16450, but NS was the original source for the 16550 series (and I strongly suspect that they developed the others first, too).  I can also tell you that i am one of those who will not buy a UART made by anyone other than National Semiconductor.     --jim  --                                    73 DE N5IAL (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W AMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.
