From: hendersond@iccgcc.decnet.ab.com (Doug Henderson) Subject: Kaypro 286 jumper settings  I received a Kaypro 286i computer (DOS) without a manual that  describes the jumpers on the motherboard.  It came with 640KB and I up had it to 1MB.  But the computer or setup does not recognize the extra 384K.   Does anyone know if this computer is capable of greater than 640K on the main board and what jumpers are required to expand it to 1MB?  Some specs: \tKaypro main board assy number 81-621 \tPhoenix BIOS v1.51 1985  Thanks in advance, Doug
