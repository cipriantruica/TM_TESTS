Shades of James Watson!  that is exactly the way many workers have described their misgivings about the Human Genome Project.  If you take a rigid  definition of scientific research, the mere accumulation of data is not  doing science.  One of the early arguments against the project were that the  resources would be better used to focus on specific genetics-related  problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence.   The project cannot be so narrowly defined or easily described now though.
