(Did you intend a  >smiley after your comment?)   If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner is signing with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta.  I think he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he had not signed.  Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once; it lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic before he was drafted, and minor league play would not have helped. But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.    Eric (too lazy to update his sig) Roush
