Actually, that is based on the NHL is history of 7 games.  The statstical odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this does not include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made the act balanced out.  that is about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo is record is not as good and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though! it is just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie Gibson :-)  >>   Who do you think gets the start in game three? I hope it is going >>to be Blue. If the team can rally around him, maybe Moog can too.  Moog gets about *** is out of 5 for his performance from me.  I give Blue 4 starts.  Fuhr has been too tough.  Buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in time...I mean, after all, Buffalo is 3 wins, 7 losses in their last 10.  >Harry Sinden is appearance outside of B is dressing room after Game 3 >was a pathetic site. He said something really retarded to cover Sutter is >behind, This game is not about winning or losing.. . Harry,check the  it is very frustrating to lose, and you have gotta say something.  Actually it is not about winning or losing, it is how you play the game.  But when the competition is magnified to this level, 99.9% of the people only care about who wins or loses :-)  >schedule! Your team is in the playoffs and about to go on a long summer >vacation on Sunday morning!  I think Buffalo will win in 6 -- it is not like Boston is getting blown away. They lost 2 OT games -- with a different bounce, they could easily be up 2-1.  >Harry and his buttkisser Milbury will never admit that they screwed up >in a major way when they brought in one of the dumbest people in the >business,Brian Sutter. Sutter is playoff record as the head coach in St.Louis >speaks for itself. The Blues really have a chance to advance to the >second round this year...  Good point here.  Chicago is in deep trouble tonight.  The \'Hawks have a bad past history of winning the division and losing early.  When they do not finish 1st, they do okay. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Robbie Po **          1993 is STREAKERS    We do what comes naturally!
