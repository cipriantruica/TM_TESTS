Gregg, you have not provided even a title of an article to support *your* contention.  >>  This is how you support a position if you intend to have anyone >>  respect it, Gregg.  Any questions?

You also have no reason to believe it *is* an anti-Islamic slander job, apart from your own prejudices.  > I have no respect for titles, only for real content. I can look > up this article if I want, true. But I can tell you BCCI was _not_ > an Islamic bank.  Why, yes.  what is a mere report in The Times stating that BCCI followed Islamic banking rules?  Gregg *knows* Islam is good, and he *knows* BCCI were bad, therefore BCCI *cannot* have been Islamic.  Anyone who says otherwise is obviously spreading slanderous propaganda.  >                                      If someone wants to discuss > the issue more seriously then i had be glad to have a real discussion, > providing references, etc.  I see.  If someone wants to provide references to articles you agree with, you will also respond with references to articles you agree with?  Mmm, yes, that would be a very intellectually stimulating debate.  Doubtless that is how you spend your time in soc.culture.islam.  i have got a special place for you in my... \x0c ...kill file.  Right next to Bobby.  Want to join him?  The more you post, the more I become convinced that it is simply a waste of time to try and reason with Moslems.  Is that what you are hoping to achieve?   mathew
