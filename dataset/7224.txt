You raise a valid point, but again it is a tradeoff -- how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection?  You could buy a Volvo, Saab, or \'Benz and get really good crash protection (and other luxuries) but you shall pay significantly more for it.  In my case it is out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget.  Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old 3-point seatbelt.  Nowadays, at least in the US, you get an airbag if you get a 3-point belt so (presumably) you get an added safety benefit there as well.  that is something I certainly look for and which can be had in inexpensive cars.  My $.02, of course.  jim frost jimf@centerline.com
