Maybe. i have had an Epson portable with backlit LCD since 1988 which is still used daily and the screen on that is fine. The only problem it has (and ever has had) is the  arm  of the screen is sorta lose and if you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it round a bit. But other than that, it is been perfect! So what is that, about um, 60 months???!  *-----------------------------------------+-------------------------* | Justin Sullivan (System Administrator)  |  DIALix Services Sydney | +-----------------------------------------+  Modem    (02) 948 6918 | |       justin@sydney.dialix.oz.au        |  Ph Perth (09) 244 2433 | *-----------------------------------------+-------------------------*
