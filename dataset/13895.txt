THere had be a different kind of space race then!  i shall say!  Imagine that there were a couple groups up there, maybe landing a few weeks apart.  The year-mark starts coming on for the first group. is not a billion pretty good incentive to take a shot at a potential winner?   Yeah, that is a shame that Team A is life support gave out so close to the deadline.  Thanks for the billion.   On the other hand, if Apollo cost ~25billion, for a few days or weeks in space, in 1970 dollars, then will not the reward have to be a lot more than only 1 billion to get any takers?  -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk      As the radius of vision increases, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm    the circumference of mystery grows. -------------------------------------------------------------------------
