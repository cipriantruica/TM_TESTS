From: Kay Alexander  Subject: Quadra 800 problem & question  I just got a Quadra 800 8/230 and i have noticed that I cannot change the desktop color from the beautiful gray.  I thought maybe I should reinstall the OS using the  Install Me First, Macintosh Centris, Quadra...  diskette because the system file on this diskette is more recent than the one on the hard disk.  The easy install selects  Macintosh Cnetris System Software .  Does anyone know if I should use this or customize and use  System Software for any Macintosh ?  Or does it matter?  THANKS in advance for any suggestions...  Kay Alexander Old Dominion University BITNET: kba100s@oduvm INTERNET: kba100s@oduvm.cc.odu.edu
