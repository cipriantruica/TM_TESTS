From: dbld@oz.plymouth.edu (d^2) Subject: xwd and color  Anyone able to get xwd to dump anything that is not black & white?  My text is not black....all I get is window borders.  I tried the -xy option only because I did not know what it did.....still no effect.  Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated.
