Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base. They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!  >>I disagree, in that I do not think it *is* a _tangible_ skill, any more than >>leadership is.

A catcher is defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his  recent offensive level of performance.   Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in  the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger  in two short years.  The rule does not apply to perceived  superstars , who  get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably  considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he cannot hit.   >do not believe in catchers\' >era.

Pete Rose, in pursuing Ty Cobb is record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media magnet).  The Reds made a lot of money off that; they also wasted the prime of Eric Davis.  That may be  good business , but that does not mean I do not loathe them for it.    --    David M.
