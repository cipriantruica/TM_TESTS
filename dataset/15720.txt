The bears are a national treasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it do so at their own risk.  It is better that that rare human be killed by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy visitors.  The bears are not having a population explosion, humans are so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears. I do not agree with this philosopy, but I understand it.  \tThe psychos are a bit different.  They are not a national treasure but I suppose the decision has been made that to  allow  provision for defense against them would also  allow  provision for defense against bears.  Again, I suppose it has been decided that it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than to take a chance on threatening the bears.  \tPersonally, I would not go into an area where I would be  managed  so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to think of it I guess I live in a managed wilderness myself :-)  Joan V
