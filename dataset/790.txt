[rest of rant deleted]  This is a standard argument for fundies.  Can you spot the falicy? The statement is arguing from the assumption that Jesus actually existed.  So far, they have not been able to offer real proof of that existance.  Most of them try it using the (very) flawed writings of Josh McDowell and others to prove it, but those writers use VERY flawed sources.  (If they are real sources at all, some are not.)  When will they ever learn to do real research, instead of believing the drivel sold in the Christian bookstores.  rh> Righto, DAN, try this one with your Cornflakes...  rh> The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was rh> crazy ( a  modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he rh> said he was.
