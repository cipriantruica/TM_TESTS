From: rdi@cci632.cci.com (Rick Inzero) Subject: Drafting Machine for sale  For sale:  Precision drafting machine, Bruning OGP-0180.  Solid older model with spring-loaded counter balance; clamps on table.  Without scales.  For right handed person.  $60/make offer, includes UPS/parcel post  postage.  i am guessing that it is from the 1940s or 1950s, a period well known for  excellent drafting machine construction! :-) it is built with real metal parts, not cheap modern plastic, and it is painted  the typical office grey popular in that period.  it is smooth working, and  each of the two  arms  on it measures roughly 24 .  It has a dual clamp to  enable you to clamp it on the edge or corner of a table.  --- Rick Inzero\t\t\t\t        rochester!cci632!rdi Northern Telecom, LTD       \t\t\tuunet!ccicpg!cci632!rdi Rochester, NY\t\t\t\t\trdi@cci.com
