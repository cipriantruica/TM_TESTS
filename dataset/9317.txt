Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  There are very few disciplines where 100% certainty is necessary to state something as fact.  Baseball is not one of them.  Therefore I can say that I know Clemens was better than Morris last year, and Larkin was better than Griffin.  No, I cannot ascertain this. I cannot prove it.  But i am not required to do so.  And since you obviously feel that such threads are meaningless, why do not you simply stay out of them?  -Valentine (No, i am not going to be cordial.
