Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn is and Ulcerative Colitis.   Previously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice has now changed.  Also, there will be differences in advice in patients with and without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will be  important.  I find the dietician very important in my practice, and  I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing them, since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories and evaluate the contents of a diet than I do.
