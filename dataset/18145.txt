Let me clue you in on this newsgroup. t.p.m is populated largely by people whose hatred for the U.S. government, especially the government of Mr. Clinton, is literally boundless. To these people, the suggestion that agents of the U.S. government would carry out a spectacular massacre of its own citizens, in full view of TV cameras, is not an \'extraordinary claim\'. it is just another day in the life of these United States.  They do not have to suggest any reason why the FBI would want to publicly massacre citizens. Have you seen \'The Crying Game\'?   \t it is in their nature .   Don Pajerek  Standard disclaimers apply.
