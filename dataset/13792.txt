Subject: help for school From: mcrandall@eagle.wesleyan.edu  I am a newbie to the net, and I am trying to get some information for a paper I am working on to get back into college.  If anyone can send me data on Solar coronal holes and recurrant aurora  for the past thirty years it would be a big help.  Or, if you have information on more esoteric things like Telluric current, surge bafflers power companies use, or other effects sporatic aurora have on the Earth is magnetic field, i had be eternally gratefull.  Please send  anything interesting to me at         Marty Crandall-Grela         Van Vleck Observatory         Wesleyan University         Middletown,Ct 06487  or e-mail it to me at mcrandall@eagle.wesleyan.edu  Thank-you in advance,      Marty
