Why would they care?  there is a strong possibility that the Bucs have absolutely no other catching   prospects in the minors at this point -- at least nobody ready for any serious   AAA/majors duty.  The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be   just age, especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mid-30s or something.   All things considered, though, i had be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind   the plate than Prince.  is not there decent backup backstop out there looking   for work?  > Sherri Nichols > snichols@adobe.com  -- David J.(dwarner@journalism.indiana.edu)*****Blue Riddle Productions 1993 *-------------------------------it is on.--------------------------------* *** THE RAP IS AN ART EP  is coming out on tape -- this time for real.*** *------------------------E-mail me for the 411.-------------------------*
