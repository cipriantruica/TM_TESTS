(Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.  |>  |> Secondly, I do not like menus.

The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a  real  scope :-)  |> Last but not least, you never know if the waveform displayed is old |> or recent, noisy or just incoherently modulated, heck, you do not |> even know if it really looks the way it is displayed.

I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out. |>  |> There are only three situations for which I would prefer a digital |> scope: Looking at what happened before the trigger, looking at rare |> events, and acquiring the data to have my computer play with it. |>  |>  |> let us hope scope manufacturers are listening... |>  |> Best regards, |> Jeroen Belleman |> jeroen@dxcern.cern.ch  One more thing about the new,  simpler , front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.
