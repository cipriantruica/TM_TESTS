I am stating that a person who shows a continually biased opinion is close-minded and that his opinion should be ignored.  Clayton is stating that a group of at least two million (1%) American citizens are evil vicious malicious child-molesters.       Here is a hypothetical question...  If Clayton said something like  all those niggers are really stupid.   (Please do not be offended, i am not racist but merely using an example of Clayton is malign logic).  And then said he read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school, I bet he would not have your support.  Yet he can claim that all homosexuals are dishonest, evil, lying child molesters without *PERSONALLY* having a single homosexual friend or acquaintance and you shall sit there and support him.       God created a place for bigots.  it is called Hell and Clayton is going to burn there for a long time.  I pray for him to find in his heart the Christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers and sisters, because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never be righteous.
