At least last night there was some excitement. The Pens  did not have it wrapped up before the game was half over like  the previous two games. i am not sure if NJ just rose up and  played better or if the Penguins just started to play down  somewhat. Probably it was somewhere in between. New Jersey  seemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end. They  did much more swarming around, which at least kept an  element of suspense in the game. No question that Billington  helped make it more interesting also. Claude Lemieux did not  help the cause any though, with his ejection early in the  game. So, who has going to start in the Devils goal for the   final  game Sunday? ;-) Sorry. I could not help myself.  -- _____________________________________________________________________________ Tom Huot        \t\t\t        huot@cray.com  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
