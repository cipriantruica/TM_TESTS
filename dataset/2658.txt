From: Mark Woodruff  Subject: Bigger window headings  Does anyone know of bigger raster fonts?  i am using a Mag 15H monitor with a Diamond SS24X in 1280x1024 mode and would prefer to have larger characters for the windows heading (practically for everything).  i am already using the 8514 character sets.  mark  Any idea of the difference between the 15H and the 15F?
