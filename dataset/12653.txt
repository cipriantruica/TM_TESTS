Herman, I would think you of all people would/could distinguish between  health  and  treatment of disease.  All the prevention medicine people preach this all the time. You cannot buy health. You can buy treatment of disease, assuming you are lucky enough to have a disease which can be treated. A rich person with a terminal disease is a bit out of luck. There is no such thing as  adequately covered  and there never will be.   And for what it is worth, i shall be the first to admit that all my patients die.  -km
