I saw the Mach III and was not all that impressed -- it looked WAY too Japanese for me... the tear drop headlights reminded me of a Nissan NX...  Glad I did not hold out for the \'94 and bought a \'93.  Maybe they will work on the design a little bit, listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking \'95 or \'96.  It always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design, e.g. the F-body Camaro/Firebirds (btw, the new Camaros look like shit too). --  Keath Milligan, Software Engineer, VideoTelecom Corporation, Austin, Texas jkm@vtel.com, reaper@wixer.bga.com -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Try Real/Time Communications!
