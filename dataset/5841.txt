From: gld@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Gary L Dare) Subject: soft contact lens cleaning unit (heater)   My girlfriend switched to gas-permeable hard lenses and no longer needs a one year old soft contact lens cleaning unit.  it is one of those where you pop in the lens case filled with solution and the lenses, press the lighted timer button and let it cook.  No stains (of course -- if you have owned one of these, you understand), maybe a little dust on the cover.  Best cash offer, or equivalent worth in used CD is or Betamax tapes (some blanks or a couple of pre-recorded movies/concerts).  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.
