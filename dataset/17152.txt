From: jar2e@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU (Virginia is Gentleman) Subject: Re: UVA  Pete-- That was uncalled for. i am sure Andi Beyer or whatever his name is was a product of his environment before he came to school, and is enjoying the mantle of THE UNIVERSITY to make his viewpoint seem legitimate (well-reasoned). i am at Virginia, too, and I think  maligning UVA is in poor taste, even if Beyer did slip in here.
