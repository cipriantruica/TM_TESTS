Tsk. Surely you do not wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? that is rather a petty way to think. (Not that this pettiness does not extend all the way to the U.S. Senate, i have noticed...)  While Bush was president, I kept hoping and praying that he had wise up. I could not stand the man, but I wish he had done a decent job; if so, we might not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for suffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job. Even if you are certain he will not.      ...so I propose that we destroy the moon, neatly solving that problem.
