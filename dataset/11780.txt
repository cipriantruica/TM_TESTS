From: tsp@ccd.harris.com (Timothy S. Pillsbury) Subject: need ACS tutorial and/or netlist examples   I recently ftp had Al is Circuit Simulator (ACS) and i am looking for the tutorial which is mentioned in the Users Manual (but not found there). I do not have any experience constructing a netlist (such as for SPICE) and I need a little help.  The examples which come with ACS are not explanatory about the translation between schematic and netlist. Does anyone have the fabled  Tutorial  or any other reference which could help me in constructing a netlist from a schematic diagram?  (I also emailed Al himself but received no response yet. he has probably  busy with his next release.) --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tim Pillsbury          Internet:  tsp@ccd.harris.com                           uunet:  uunet!ccd.harris.com!timothy.pillsbury -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
