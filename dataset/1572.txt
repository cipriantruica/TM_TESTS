From: rajsnr@IASTATE.EDU (S N Rajesh) Subject: Looking for a job as a Software Engineer  I am not sure that I am supposed to post this mail here. However during the last year, while I was involved in developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications, I have enjoyed being personally part of this news group wherin I got some interesting information which helped me in my work. I am posting my resuming hoping that people working in my area would make time to look at it. ________________________________________________________________________________ _ \t\t\t\t\t\t304A WestGate Hall, \t\t\t\t\t\tISU, Ames, IA 50011. \t\t\t\t\t\t(515) 294 1525 \t\t\t\t\t\tApril 29, 1992.  Dear Prospective Employer:  I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software design and development, in which I can utilize my experience in hardware,  C & C++ programming, graphical user interface (GUI), operating systems and computer networking.  I received my Bachelors of Engineering (BE) degree in Electronics Engineering in 1990 and a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec 1992  from Iowa State University. Currently I am enrolled in a M.S. in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University.  During my Masters program, as a research assistant since Jan 1991, I have published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics. These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability to learn new concepts quickly.  I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and have extensive experience programming in C, C++, Fortran and Assembly Level.  I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix, Ultrix and MS-DOS. I am familiar with Motif/X programming and currently, as a research assistant, am involved in graphical user interface (GUI) design using the multiplatform  GUI toolkit XVT++. My experiences also include areas such as operating systems and computer networks, through course work and projects. I was involved in the study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating system. I have also been involved in many TCP/IP programming projects in computer networking.  While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise communication. I have also learned a lot about time management. In my M.S. program I have maintained a 3.70 grade average, worked 20 hours per week and have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.  My software experiences along with my hardware background (Electronics Engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer. I request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed. I would like to have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals.  I am eager to hear from you soon.   Sincerely  S.N.
