I find this a very disturbing view!  Yes, we DO care about EVERYONE is privacy... Even if  they  do not know it. What happens if the gov\'t starts creating legislation such that the Clipper and such technologies become the only  legal  encryption forms?  What happens when the Clipper is the *ONLY* type of encryption chips available to the masses?  Sure, you might have your own method of encryption, but if you do not have anyone else to talk to, what use is it?  You cannot assume that EVERYONE will be as open as you appear to be about encryption.  The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip. Rather, it is like having the government telling you that they want a copy of your house key, safe-deposit box keys, etc., and telling you that  they wont use them unless its totally neccessary.   I sure would not want that.  Why should encryption be any different?  - -derek  PGP 2 key available upon request on the key-server: \tpgp-public-keys@toxicwaste.mit.edu  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: 2.2  iQBuAgUBK9RxVjh0K1zBsGrxAQHd8ALEDi3Ear7rEmr1UHuxqv2YIblH6px6VXnb +sJLcUGzZxTCfxbRqIf7msLp98p0EvYYnLZbbORyVhfSzyyHYHeQqQILHEK3LPQE aP29+od6YZrCCHarNRS024E= =Ftek -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- --   Derek Atkins, MIT \'93, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science      Secretary, MIT Student Information Processing Board (SIPB)            MIT Media Laboratory, Speech Research Group            warlord@MIT.EDU       PP-ASEL        N1NWH
