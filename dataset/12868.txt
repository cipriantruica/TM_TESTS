From: ab961@Freenet.carleton.ca (Robert Allison) Subject: Bursitis and laser treatment   My family doctor and the physiotherapist (PT) she sent me to agree that the pain in my left shoulder is bursitis. I have an appointment with an orthpod (I love that, it is short for \'orthopedic surgeon, apparently) but while i am waiting the PT is treating me.  she is using hot packs, ultrasound, and lasers, but there is no improvement yet. In fact, I almost suspect it is getting worse.  My real question is about the laser treatment. I cannot easily imagine what the physical effect that could have on a deep tissue problem. Can anyone shed some light (so to speak) on the matter? --  Robert Allison Ottawa, Ontario CANADA
