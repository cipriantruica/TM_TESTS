To just about everyone.  I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from government sources except two.  As far as I am concerned, I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise.  The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given  NATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally, in a chopped-up fashion, and that is all.  And even then, they cleverly  cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded  national exposure,  but not so cleverly that we did not hear it.  The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript. we will never know if he would have kept that one.  > \tThe FBI etc. cannot wait forever for Koresh to come out.

Quite possible.
