From: alerman@netcom.com (Alexander Lerman) Subject: 486-33 Tower Without a Fan???  I originally posted a complaint about how noisy my PC was. I got several  useful suggestions, but 1 was the most seductive: run your PC in silence by  removing the fan altogether!  Two variables:  1) I always run my PC without the cover, and  2) i had be willing to attach a CPU cooler if that would make a difference.  Should I try to run my PC without a fan? I know it sounds like utter folly so  i am asking - has anyone done this succesfully? Or tragically? you are answer  may save my PC... Thanks. --  Alexander Lerman  (510) 848-4888 (voice)
