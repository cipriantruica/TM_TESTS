When the Turkish authorities \tannounced that they were going to search these cargo  \tplanes 3 of these planes returned to it is base in Germany. \t5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of \tof the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not \thumanitarian aid.....  \tSearch Turkish planes? You do not know what you are talking about. \tTurkey is government has announced that it is giving weapons \tto Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan \tit self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons \tsince it is content is announced to be weapons?        Hilmi Eren Dept. of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University Sweden Hilmi-er@dsv.su.se
