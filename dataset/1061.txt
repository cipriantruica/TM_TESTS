Do an intersection calculation in the plane in 2D, where you are guaranteed a unique solution (unless they are parallel which will not happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.  Hope I have not put my foot in it again!  steve --- --  +---------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ | Steven Collins\t\t\t| email: steve@crl.hitachi.co.jp | | Visiting Computer Graphics Researcher\t| phone: (0423)-23-1111 \t | | Hitachi Central Research Lab.
