From: anwar+@cs.cmu.edu (Anwar Mohammed) Subject: Re: Zionism   I really do not know how you can possibly maintain this hypocritical stance.  On the one hand, you imply that there is a conspiracy of Arab-Americans that warrants the illegal gathering of information on them (ie. auto license/ registration information in California) and other forms of  monitoring , including blatant attempts by paid ADL agents to discredit an American-Arab  organization by trying to distribute Nazi propaganda.  Furthermore, you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing  to the WTC bombing, in which Arab-Americans had no involvement.  On the other hand, you publish this excerpt, which seems to rail against notions of a racial (Jewish, in this case) conspiracy and stereotypes.  If you really are not the hypocrite you appear to be, please explain  yourself.
