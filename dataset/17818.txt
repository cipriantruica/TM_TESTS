Let the  GREAT CHUCKMEISTER  make a couple predictions, if you will:  1.  The sun will rise tomorrow. 2.  Rush will bash Clinton on his next show. 3.  I will turn out to be Clinton is love child.  Chances are, i shall get at least one of those right, if i am lucky. I may even get two.  >      Now, for more AAMMMAAAAZZZZZZIINNNNGGGGG Predictions! > >      i)   The NST will be raised from 3% to 5% by 1996. >\t   Ooops.

Congress does it.  All those who voted the Clinton ticket get to wear this *new* label.....  +----------------+ |     SUCKA!     | |                | |  Made in USA   |   +----------------+  Hook, line, and sinker!  *chuckle*  cpk --  it is been 80 days.
