From: gtoal@gtoal.com (Graham Toal) Subject: Re: How does it really work? (was Re: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption)  \tFrom: Marc VanHeyningen   \tThe majority of the discussion involving this  Clipper Chip  seems to \tpertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone \tknow if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog \tsignals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it is hard to say.  i had lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect to make it a phone you had need a codec and speech compression.  There would be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper any of the suggestions i have seen here about putting a different encryption front end on it.  there is no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  i am sure it is purely a digital chip.  The back end will come later, but i am *positive* it will not be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.  The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones. (Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true, bwahahaha! ;-) )  G
