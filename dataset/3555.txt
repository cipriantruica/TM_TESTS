From: vixie@pa.dec.com (Paul A Vixie) Subject: Re: 17  monitor with RGB/sync to VGA ??  Yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 BNC is on it, and is expecting to get a composite sync signal on the  green ?  There ought to be a little black box that takes the VGA signalling (which has horiz, vert, and composite sync on different pins, plus the R, G, and B pairs) and merges the green and composite sync together in the output.  it is all 1V analog, as far as I know.  I can build this with op-amps but I do not think I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen.  Does anyone know of a VGA->RGB(composite sync on green) converter? -- Paul Vixie, DEC Network Systems Lab\t Palo Alto, California, USA         \t do not be a rebel, or a conformist;  decwrl!vixie\t\tthey are the same thing, anyway.
