This analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two squirts about credibility.   In addition, Apple is proclaimed purpose in releasing the Macintosh was not survellience.  Quite the opposite:  On January 24, Apple will introduce.... Macintosh, and you shall see why 1984 will not be, like \'1984\'   So do not give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to put mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more.   >In the Clipper case, a representative body of experts is going to be allowed >to audit it, and we will have assurances (maybe even from the President) that >other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors.

One of the reasons we should be all the more suspicious.  When was the last time the president wasted his time to comfort americans? Just another reason to look closely at exactally what is going on.  >David >--  >David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of >                         our information, errors and omissions excepted.    uni@acs.bu.edu --  uni@acs.bu.edu  ->  Public Keys by finger and/or request Public Key Archives:   Sovereignty is the sign of a brutal past.Fight Clinton is Wiretap Chip!
