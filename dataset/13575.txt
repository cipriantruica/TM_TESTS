And where do you advise people to turn for cancer information?    Most >(maybe all) of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern >treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer, and >many of the treatments are quite dangerous as well.  It seems to me you have offered a circular refutation of Moss is organization. Who has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could it be those \'regulatory\' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these interests exist, then the \'fact\' that some of the information put out by PAC has been refuted by the medical industry does not hold much weight.  As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH did not find them effective does not make much sense here. Of course they did not! I tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH is record for investigation of \'alterna- tive\' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find- ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.  gn
