From: yuri@physics.heriot-watt.ac.UK (Yuri Rzhanov) Subject: REPOST: XView slider  Hi Xperts,  this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-( I cannot believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)...  i am using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!   As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, does not work in the case of slider, despite the fact that  contains the following bit:  \t/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item, \t * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes \t */ \tPANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL\t= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,\t\t\t 152), \tPANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH\t= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,\t\t 182),  which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get\'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.  Strange thing is that DEC is port of XView gives plenty of space in a text fields, but not Sun is Xview...  Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me, and clear this problem?   Any help is very much appreciated.  Yuri  yuri@uk.ac.hw.phy
