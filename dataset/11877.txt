From: segal@rtsg.mot.com (Gary Segal) Subject: Pinout needed for TIL311  i have recently picked up some TIL311 display chips, but I cannot find any information on them.  It seems they are no longer made by TI, and I do not have an old enough data book.  :-(  It appears to have a dot-matrix led display capable of showing one hex digit.  It is in a 14 pin DIP package, but pins 6, 9, and 11 are not present.  If you have any information on this part (pinout, power requirments, functions, ...) please send me e-mail.  Thank You,  --  Gary Segal                             Motorola Inc.             segal@oscar.rtsg.mot.com               Cellular Infrastructure Division \t--- we are standing here only to gaze at the wind ---
