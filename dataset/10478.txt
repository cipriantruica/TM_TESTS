From: RRHAMMER@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu Subject: Pierre Turgeon a stud!  Being a a BLUES fan I do not get to see much else from around the league with the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN.  I cannot get the BLUES games where I go to school, thus I do not get to see a whole lot of other teams play except for the Hawks.  But last night I got to catch a glimpse of the Caps/Isles game.  It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates. His moves are quick and brilliant.  You NY fans should be proud. P.S. Who won the game (Caps/Isles)?   Peace, Hammer
