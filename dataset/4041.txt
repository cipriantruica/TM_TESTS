Anyone know where I can pick up a pair of refurbished PS is for cheap (preferably mail order). Yes, I do have uses planned fior them.  One will be sold to a friend who just needs a terminal to connect via modem to his e-mail account. The other will be used by me as a net client to run my downloads and/or printing.    Also, what is the latest system software usable with these suckers?
