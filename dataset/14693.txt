From: noye@midway.uchicago.edu (vera shanti noyes) Subject: Re: harrassed at work, could use some prayers  i had just like to repeat and emphasize that because someone else is trying to make you feel horrible and worthless does not mean that you should feel that way, although that is easier to say than believe sometimes.  remember, God made you and loves you, so he must think you are something special.  (excuse the trite language here.)  also, the bully may just be someone who is mean for no reason -- not out of intentional mental torture.  has anyone else been harassed?  maybe they are just not talking about it.    i would have emailed but my reactions were not fast enough and the post i am responding to did not include your address.  just take courage and remember that all of us on the net are rooting for you.  take care! vera _______________________________________________________________________________ Hand over hand\t\t\t\tnoye@midway.uchicago.edu does not seem so much\t\t\t(Vera Noyes) Hand over hand\t\t\t\t Is the strength of the common touch\tdrop me a line if you are in the mood \t- Rush,  Hand Over Fist  _______________________________________________________________________________
