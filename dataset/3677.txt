Anyone?   \tTo be honest, up until now, I have only found one bug in the  \tDiamond Viper drivers, and it seems innocuous.  \tThat is, under Microsoft Word, select Format Border, click \tshading and take a look at the patterns.  The 5% pattern \thas been swapped with the 90%, and so on.  The whole list \tis _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take \tit to another machine (i.e., a GUP or ss24x machine) or \tprint it and iy shows--badly!    \tKeep in mind that I use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so I cannot \tspeak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty  \tsolid.  --  \t what is big, noisy and has an IQ of 8?   \t Operation Rescue.
