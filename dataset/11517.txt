Someone posted such an address on CompuServe a few months ago, but apparently the White House was not really set up to recive hundreds (thousands?) of messages a day to that account and did not want people to use it yet. So is this MCI address something the people at the White House actually read, or is it another Craig Shergold story? I do not know -- i am just asking.  Unless the people at the White House print and distribute this mail every day, you may have better luck printing out a letter (on paper, that flat white stuff all over my desk) and Snail-Mailing it to the White House. I imagine writing to your local representative and senator would not hurt either. Heck, why not write to Al Gore while you are at it?  \t\t\t\tgreg\t  --  Greg Brail ------------------ Citibank -------------------- gjb@fig.citib.com
