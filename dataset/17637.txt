Fishing rights are disputed.  Between 2 nations, no matter *how*  friendly, there is ALWAYS fishing disputes.  What I was getting at was the 54 40\' or fight slogan is OLD STUFF dealing with the LAND dispute.  No one is saying 54 40\' or fight  about fishing rights.  The territorial dispute about the Oregon Territory (we called it) is LONG resolved.  Fishing rights...small potatoes.   --   Personal opinions? Why,     BRENT IRVINE   yes.
