Evelyn Wells, on the 12 Apr 1993 11:43 CST wibbled: : Once again, this morning I pulled up to the designated motorcycle : parking area, only to find a cage pulled up behind the bikes.  : If people do not double-park cars, why do they do it to motorcycles? : Never mind that rhetorical question, I know *why* they do it.  : What I want to know is, what can I do about it?  Carry pieces of : paper that say  do not park your car in the motorcycle area!!  ? : Call the cops?  Wait until they emerge from the building and berate : them until they beg forgiveness?    : Does anyone else have this problem, and what do you do about it?  : Evie  I do not know if you have a local branch where you are, but the preferred method over here is to \'phone the IRA and tell them about the car and that it  belongs to an MP who is on a Northern Ireland Government Committee.  An hour or so later, and the car is no longer a problem.  it is best not to park too  close to it, though. --  Nick (the Vengeful Biker)   DoD 1069   Concise Oxford   Plastic  M\'Lud.    ___\t___   ___   ___  { _ } { _ } { _ } { _ }\t  Nick Pettefar, Contractor@Large.   \' `\t` \'   \' `   ` \'\t\t  Currently incarcerated at BNR,   ___\t___   ___   ___\t\t  Maidenhead, The United Kingdom.  | _ | | _ | | _ | | _ |\t  npet@bnr.ca  \'86 BMW K100RS  Kay    ` \'\t\' `   ` \'   \' `\t\t  Pres.
