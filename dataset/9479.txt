From: fls@keynes.econ.duke.edu (Forrest Smith) Subject: Braves  Stoppers    \tThe term  stopper  is generally used to refer to a pitcher, one who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going on a losing streak.  \tThe Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description, although right now i had expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.  \tWhat the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper, somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump. there is just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best pure hitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.\t  \tOh, and another thing that worries me.  Ron Gant seems to have slowed down a step.  that is scary.  A slow Ron Gant does not have much going for him. --        fls      fls     fls@econ.duke. s  To my correspondents:  My email has been changed.                       e l                         My new address is:  fls             d f            If mail bounces, try fls@raphael.acpub.duke.edu               u
