From: cui@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Jun Cui) Subject: How to respond to WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK?  i am using BC++ is ObjectWindows (3.1), trying to resond to the left button double click message WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK in a combo box.

Any help would be appreciated.  -- jun To talk to the Lord with PS/2 through MS-Windows
