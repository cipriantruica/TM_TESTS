MO drives exist already for computers.  they are expensive : and a bit slow, but the disks are cheep (128 mb disks).  Dan.  I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply  MD is a purely audio format, we would not use it for data , then when pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!  What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio player prices. i had assume that the problem here is that an MD system can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear does not pick up the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- david shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625                 inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq \t\t They did not like the rates, they do not like the poll tax, \t\t and they will not like the council tax.    - Nicholas Ridley
