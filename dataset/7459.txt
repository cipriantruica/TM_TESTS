From: alan@elroy.Jpl.Nasa.Gov (Alan S. Mazer) Subject: Re: what is the deal with  blue-book  value of an auto?  Mail bounced, so...  In article  you write: >i am in the process of buying a new auto.  i have not decided yet whether >i should sell my current car myself or trade it in as part of the new >auto purchase.  Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it  yourself if you do not mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing.  >i know that the  blue book  value for the car is $2825.  I assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for retail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can  get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself. Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for California.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what it is selling for (if any used lots have one) or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It  might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for 6 months for the best price).  >an acquaintence >has offered to give me blue book value for the car.  I do not know what you mean by  an acquaintance  but I would make darn sure that I was paid, that is, cashier is check in full before delivery.  there is a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating than you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start (with a cashier is check or cash) then I would go elsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.  that is probably a safer approach than selling to a private party. --    -- Alan                          Mountain Dew and doughnuts...    ..!ames!elroy!alan            because breakfast is the most important meal    alan@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov       of the day.
