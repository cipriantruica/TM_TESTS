But close El Segundo (el subliminal) is the infamous Paul (birthname Saul) the Evangeline who became famous as a result of his numerous trampoline act  tours of the eastern Mediterranean.  Jesus on the other hand was duped, a pawn of the Con, fell pray to the Holywood Paradox (am not nothing but a sign in the hills!). Like many Afro-Asians, Jesus found the earth all too pink! And to think that after his death, the Con changed him into a tall blond Holywood sun god! And I  do mean that in the kindest way possums!
