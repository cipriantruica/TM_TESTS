Truly, truly, I say to  \tyou, if you shall ask the Father for anything, He will give it to you  \tin my name.  Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask, and  \tyou will receive, that your joy may be made full.  \t\t\t\t-John 16:23-24  I do not believe that we necessarily have to say   . . . In Christ is name.   Amen,  for our prayers to be heard, but it glorifies the Son, when we  acknowledge that our prayer is made possible by Him.  I believe that just as  those who were saved in the OT, could only be saved because Jesus would one day reconcile God to man, He is the only reason their prayers would be heard by  God.  \tFor all of us have become like one who is unclean, \tAnd all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; \tAnd all of us wither like a leaf, \tand our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. \t\t\t\t-Isaiah 64:6, NAS  Our prayers like the rest of our deeds are too unholy to go directly to the Father because they are tainted by our sin.  Only by washing these prayers with Christ is blood are they worthy to be lifted to to the Father.  \t First, I thank my God through Christ Jesus . . .  \t\t\t\t-Romans 1:8, NAS  Some scholars believe that this is Paul recognizing that even his thanks are  too unholy for the Father. \tBasically, prayer is a gift of grace, I believe that only through Jesus do our prayers have any power; thus, praying in His name glorifies and praises  Jesus for this beautiful and powerful gift He has given us.  +-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-= Carter C.
