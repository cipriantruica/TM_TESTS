From: anthonyf@microsoft.com (Anthony Francisco) Subject: Re: Clipper and Ranting Libertarians  Just a little nitpicking. was not it the government that required a standard railway gauge ? did not that improve things ?  Please do not misunderstand. i am utter suspicious of this Clipper chip. Why hold the design TOP SECRET ? Was this a work around the law that says that any discoveries made by people working for the government is public domain. ( e.g. NIH Class Library, etc. ) DES has its designs published all over the place and it is considered fairly strong ( although could be stronger ).  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Ants
