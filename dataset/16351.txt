The NRA is an educational organization too, after all, and it would be a shame to pay all that money for new guns when these cheap guns would allow a lot of money thus saved to be used in opening more classes.  Mention that the NRA trains our boys in blue and you have got the media between a rock and a hard place.  \t City pays $50 per gun to reduce crime.  \t\t\tor \t NRA to pay $50 per gun to provide training guns for police \t and citizens.  Classes expanded with money saved.
