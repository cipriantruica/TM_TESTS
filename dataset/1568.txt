From: mad-celt@cwis.unomaha.edu (Andy Booth) Subject: SYNERGY: Revolt - an OTIS colaberation project  The OTIS Project presents...         SYNERGY: Revolt  \t...the first in a continuing series of collaborative \tart initiatives designed to exploit the binarity \tof the infosphere.  This series of diversely  \tstructured art-manipulation projects will attempt \tto stretch across network boundries encouraging \tuse of electronic mail, fax, video, photography, \tscanned  conventional  art and even sound to  \tcreate multi-artist  still  visuals in GIF and  \tJPG formats.  Visualists from all technical levels \tare welcome.    \tREVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be  \tthree stages of production.  The first stage will \tconsist of all participants creating one still  \twork as a  starter  piece that two other partici- \tpants will, in turn, manipulate.  All first stage \t base  images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993,  \tmidnight Central Daylight Time.   \tStage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will  \tbe sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant \tfor them to do manipulations on in anyway they see  \tfit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist \tof filtering the image through their favorite paint \tprogram.  For  analog  artists, this may well be \tprinting a hardcopy of the image and adding their \town part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan- \tning in the image again to be transferred on to  \tthe third-stage artist.  All second-stage works \tare due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.  \tStage three is the finishing stage and will begin \ton May 31st.  All artists will do what they think  \tit takes to finish up the image they have been given \tusing whatever technique they see as worthy.   \tThese images will be due on June 6th, midnight.  \tAll involved will participate in each stage of \tcreation.  \t----------------------------------------------------------- \tTo join, send email/mail with the following info:  \tName: \temail address: \tmail address: \tscanner access?
