Wax them out? >help!   Car accessory shops here sell stuff called T-Cut, which is a very fine cutting paste for paint, and this will remove the dull finish and minor acratches. It will also remove all the traffic film and stuff that you probably do not realise is there, and give your paintwork its original lustre and shine. It can sometimes react badly with metallic paint, though, so try it out carefully before going to town with the stuff. Afterwards apply wax polish, and all will be well again.  BTW - do not confuse T-cut with the cutting paste used for grinding in  valves...the principle is the same but the coarseness is vastly different...  Mike
