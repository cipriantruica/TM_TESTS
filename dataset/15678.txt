Please, PAY ATTENTION. I, and others, were referring to TOTAL HOMICIDE DEATHS, NOT JUST HANDGUN HOMICIDES.  In terms of how likely are you to be killed, (regardless of how it is done, because DEAD is DEAD), the UK has a higher homicide rate. Period.  You are more likely to be killed in the UK than in Switzerland.  If you were to be murdered with a handgun, then yes, Switzerland has a higher rate.  But, to belabor the point, you are MORE LIKELY to be murdered in the UK. In that sense, the weapon is irrelevant.  The UK is more violent, period.  Al [standard disclaimer]  >
