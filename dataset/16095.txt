Your neighbors think you are a quiet, upstanding citizen.  A random person anonymously calls  the authorities and tells them you beat your children, sleep with all  the neighbor wimmen, and own a bunch of  nasty 50mm machine guns.     Now what are they supposed to do?    > Fuck him. Fuck the ATF, too. They should have done it right > the first time.  Ah, I see.  they are supposed to send 100 men in horse trailers with automatic weapons, storm onto your roof, and throw grenades at your  house with no warning.  Then, after subjecting you to noise torture and telling the national news media for a month what a filthy son of  a bitch you are, they are supposed to gas you and knock your house  around a bit until they manage to collapse it, cause a fire, or  something equally conclusive.  Hope your neighbors do not tumble to this -- at least none of them that might have a craving for a ringside seat at some cheap but dramatic  local entertainment at someone else is expense.  Or maybe even PARTICULARLY at your expense.  At least they will not have to read you your rights, Joe -- obviously you had no use for them anyway.  > joe.kusmierczak@mail.trincoll.edu --   cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\' Packet...
