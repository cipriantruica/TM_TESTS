The camel is nose in the tent, etc.)     Excuse me?  This has *already* happened.  there is a couple of humps in    the tent already.  Ask the folks at Qualcomm what became of the    non-trivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in their CDMA    digitial cellular phone standard?  There *already* are restrictions in    place.  You have it slightly wrong. They dumped the encryption system because they could not export it -- not because they could not produce it for U.S. use. There are no legal restraints on citizen use of strong cryptography -- yet. -- Perry Metzger\t\tpmetzger@shearson.com -- Laissez faire, laissez passer. Le monde va de lui meme.
