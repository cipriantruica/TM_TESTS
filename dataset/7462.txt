The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater than what the vehicle is engine can overcome it has reached its top speed. (autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance) Since drag opposes the vehicle is motion, the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or using a numerical method.  anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:              Cd = d/(q*2R)         where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius of the clyinder.    To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car is width, q at the car is speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that the car would need to overcome.         -Bp
