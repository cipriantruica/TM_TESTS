The stuff they will stock are the ones that\'ll sell, like standard DRAM is, 80386 is, 68000 is, etc,etc. i.e.  I cna\'t think of any \'one-stop-shopping\' store.  The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip through them.  Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics, etc, etc, do not normally deal with end-users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this? Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386 is.  it is a pretty good bet that they will not be selling any of AMD is 386 is, or vice-versa. They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer they represent.  Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them. But i had be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2 qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what a mail order outlet will charge.  My advice?  If you are gonna be designing anything, try to stick with off-the-shelf stuff.  you are going to get stuck if you use too many esoteric parts sooner or later.  good luck,  aaron
