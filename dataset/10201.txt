From: cbetz@radioman.cray.com (Charles Betz  {x66442 CF/ENG}) Subject: NHL team in Milwaukee   After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that Milwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought i had pass along a story I heard recently.  This is second hand, so I do not know how true it is, but I have no reason to doubt it either.  Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I cannot remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center.  Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but  turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high.  Like I said, I do not know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if it is true, do not look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals are not going to be forced out of the building and you will not see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA is Milwaukee Bucks play there as well.
