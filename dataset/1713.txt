I too have learned by example, specifically yours. :)  >What can I say but keep the faith, there are others who do likewise.  .. but dorsai leads the way.. Unlike other services that are commercial in nature, dorsai is a community based service. While others charge monthly fees for access, dorsai accepts donations from those who can afford to contribute.     While other systems do not respond to user input, dorsai thrives on it. Other systems sell hardware for a profit, dorsai donates hardware to community service groups, and to individuals who could not afford to normally.     Dorsai lives due to the  hacker  ethic of Charles, Jack, Skip, Cara, Ira, Mark, David etc etc etc..  sleepless nights and days working on equipment thats been assembled at the embassy, ( and modifying what ever else available to work the first time..) in order to keep the slip line up...     Heres to you bud... i am one of the few that decided to stay, and am damn glad that I did..... :)       --                           | Carlos Dominguez - Sys-admin, owner, kibbitzer          -(o o)-         | ----------------------------------------------  -----oOO--(_)--OOo----- | root@carlos.UUCP or uupsi!jpradley!carlos!carlos  ask me about HELLDIVER. | carlos@carlos.jpr.com    ( guaranteed address )
