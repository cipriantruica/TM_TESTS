Not always true. In fact, in the case of Doug Gilmour, he actually praises them.  Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry is opinion. Canadian kids that do them are  tough, just like a real Canadian .   Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier is ribs and Don wants Ulf is head. Doug Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom is arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming.  Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter.  I used to like Don Cherry. I thought he was great. But i am starting to see his true colors (redneck) and the more I see of them, the more I think he has just an asshole.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlan
