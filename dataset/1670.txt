From: jtheinon@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Jarkko Tapio Heinonen) Subject: FTP site for .pov files?  I know this has been asked a million time, but..  What was the ftp site carrying 30-40 .ZIPs of full POV  source  files, including JACK.ZIP and KETTLE.ZIP? i have once been there but unfortunately lost the address. i am in a little hurry with it, so please e-mail me at jtheinon@kruuna.helsinki.fi. Thanks..  Jarkko
