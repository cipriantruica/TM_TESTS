Likewise, if anybody has tried this on a flyback i had like to hear about it.  I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power transformers as the material would not damp as well--something I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be real difficult at 15 KHz).  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.
