You assume that the general public  cannot handle the truth  and then, based on this  assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a good argument, comes along and asks  why do not you just develop the spinoffs?  or  why cannot we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the military?   There are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects.  i am not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think that the general public deserves more credit than you give them.  >BTW: do not forget Velcro...  And if you are going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right. Teflon has been around since before NASA.  As I understand it, Velcro was  conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes.  Certainly velcro was  available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties.  I would need to  see some good evidence before I believe that either of these would not be here today without NASA.  --  Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu \t\t     Find a way or make one.  \t             -attributed to Hannibal
