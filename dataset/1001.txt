From: lau@auriga.rose.brandeis.edu (frankie t. k. lau) Subject: PC fastest line/circle drawing routines: HELP!  hi all,  IN SHORT: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing \t  on SVGA graphics.  COMPLETE: \tI am thinking of a simple but fast molecular graphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)  Reasons: programs that i have seen are far too slow for this purpose.  Platform: 386/486 class machine. \t  800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics \t\t(speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering \t\t purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for \t\t speed reason.)          (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA           cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)  What i am looking for? 1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes    on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.    Presumably in assembly languagine. \tYes, VERY FAST please. 2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.    Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of    text, else later.    (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule) 2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the     project.  Final remarks;- non-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.  \tAny help is appreciated. \tthanks  -Frankie lau@tammy.harvard.edu  PS pls also email, I may miss reply-post.
