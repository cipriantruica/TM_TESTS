Hell, yes. i am not going to let a bunch of seven suits tell me what the right way to estimate cost effectiveness is, at least not until they can make their mind up long enough to leave their scheme stable for a fiscal year or two.   Seriously though. If you were to ask the British government whether their colonisation efforts in the Americas were cost effective, what answer do you think you had get? What if you asked in 1765, 1815, 1865, 1915 and 1945 respectively? ;-)  *  Steinn Sigurdsson   \t\t\tLick Observatory      \t* *  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu\t\t standard disclaimer   \t* *  If you ever have to go to Shoeburyness\t\t\t* *  Take the A-road, the ok road, that is the best!\t\t* *  Go motoring on The A13!\t- BB 1983\t\t\t*
