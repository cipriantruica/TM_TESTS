From: willis oracle.SCG.HAC.COM (Stan Willis) Subject: Kings playoff notes: Stauber, TV ratings, etc.  1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes. -------------------------------- Playoffs: --------- *Stauber disturbed by third-man theme by Rick Sadowski, Daily News  Barry Melrose is decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender.   I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most fun time of the year, and i am not,   Stauber said with some emotion Monday.   I think I have worked hard enough for that.   Stauber said he accepts Melrose is choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays 6-3 opening victory.  But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.  Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was  yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and has not played since March 29.  Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey is backup again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic Saddledome popcorn.   If i am supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?   Stauber wondered.   Not that i had be happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs.   Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.  While insisting he is the Kings\'  goalie of the future,  Melrose said Stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were, according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to  Vancouver on Thursday.   Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he did not do it,  Melrose said.   An elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a great goalie is that he is not satisfied to be a backup.    i am not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you are going to be No. 1, you have got to be able to walk your talk.  you have got to be able to play when everything is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect more from him than he does.   Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump, did not play for a month after Knickle was signed off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.   I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,  said Stauber, a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only  to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.   What i have been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do expect a lot from myself, otherwise I would not be here.    Anybody who would disagree with that does not know me.  i am not saying Barry  does not know me, but do not say i have been without expectations.  If anything, i am a perfectionist.   Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned.  But  even though I did not play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? it is  a bit of a jump,  he said.   you are almost No. 1, or if you play a good game  you are No. 1 and if you do not you are No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67  and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  that is what barry wanted me to explain  to him, why I did not come through when he counted on me.  I do not know. What I  do know is, it is a sport.  i shall be there.   Melrose is  goalie of the future  statement does not mean much to Stauber.  Before you know it, i shall be 30 and there will be no future,  he said.  ------  *Game 1 of the Kings   Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC  Channel 7 here in LA.
