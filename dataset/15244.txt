From: dhammers@pacific.? (David Hammerslag) Subject: Re: Mormon Temples  In article  brh54@cas.org (Brooks Haderlie) writes:     searching out our deceased ancestors so that we can perform the    ordinances -- such as baptism, confirmation, and marriage for time and    eternity -- that are required for a person to obtain salvation through    Christ and to live with Him through the eternities. These are people    who may have not had the opportunity to know Christ in their lifetime,    so we are making it possible for Christ is saving grace (I know there    are thousands of interpretations of that phrase) to become fully    effective for them if they allow it to do so on the other side.   This paragraph brought to mind a question.  How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with Christ is statement that in the ressurection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Hammerslag (dhammers@urbana.mcd.mot.com)     ...there am not nobody so bad that the Lord cannot save \'em am not         nobody so good they do not need God is love...  -- Mullins  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
