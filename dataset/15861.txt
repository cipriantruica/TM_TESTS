If you are not a threat, you are not affected at all. :|>  : :Aha.  that is the part that makes me nervous too.  Who gets to decide if :I am a threat?  Based on appearance?  Would someone feel more threatened : Actions determine whether someone presents a threat... and I do not carry a gun so much for people, cause I tend to fade if there are any about, but due to  several encounters with formerly domestic dogs...  these critters am not scared of folks, and can get aggressive.  :on staying at and saw someone sitting there cleaning his gun.  Softly I backed :away, and hiked another 5 miles to get *out of there*.  i shall freely admit it here: :i am not afraid of guns; i am afraid of people that bring them into the backcountry. : i had count that as a fear of guns... somebody having the sense to keep their weapons maintained is not as likely to present a threat.  The Army taught me to clean any weapons DAILY, since they usually need it, regardless of whether  they have been used... you had be amazed how sweaty a holster can get, or how much trail dust will get in it.  And I guess you had be scared of me and my former Explorer Post... seems the advisors were National Guard Special Forces grunts, and considered it heresy to be out in the woods without a weapon... course,  usually you would not notice \'em... :)  They tended to avoid public scrutiny...  :Of course, that may be the way to solve the solitude problem.  Just carry a gun :and display it prominently, and one probably will not see most of the other hikers :out there, who will be hiding in the woods.  1/2 :-) : : - Dania My 9mm goes in a hip holster, mixed in with magazine pouches (hold lotsa stuff  in them), canteens, knives, compasses, and such...  Not so easy to notice, in  the off chance I decide to be visible... I prefer not to be, since walking  quietly away from active areas increases the number of non-human type critters I see...
