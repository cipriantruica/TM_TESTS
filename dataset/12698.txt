In fairness, we should note that if you look up  speculum  in the dictionary (which I did when this question first surfaced), the first definition is  a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in optical instruments.   Which does not mean the name fits in this context, but it is not as far off as you might think.    -- David Wright, Hitachi Computer Products (America), Inc.
