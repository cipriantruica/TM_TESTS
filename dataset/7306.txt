You know, i am a Ford fan, I must say, so i am looking forward to the next Mustang.  I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable than the Camaro is now.  You know, that is MHO.    The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality, just the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that can only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments; it is those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come with the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they are getting better and making the move in the right direction.  They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only in words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the end of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I would not press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it. Besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.  I do not put much stock in the mag rags\'  inside  information, or even Ford rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it is entirety.   Inside  information had the Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I would not look for a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself if you do.  there is a lot of potential.  Ford has not released a new car without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been brewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those modular V8 is are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and competition, do not rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do. And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there, who really knows what it shall look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it. Highly.  The next Mustang will be Ford is highest profile car.  It attracts way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it is heritage is more embedded in the general public.  do not lie to yourself and believe Ford will forfeit that.  I submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know, intelligent, critical spews like,  The Mustang bites, man!   Some of you are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro will be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual. The Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to the driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set. Both will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be no clear winner.  Unless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You do not seriously believe that it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you?  :^)  Regards,  Brian  bqueiser@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I am the engineer, I can choose K. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Department of Engineering Mechanics Ohio State University Columbus, OH
