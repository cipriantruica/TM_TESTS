So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is if it contradicts the Quran?  What if it relates to something that is not explicitly spelled out in the Quran?  Also, the Quran was not written down during the life of Muhammed either.  It was not long after, but 20 years or so is still long enough to shift a few verses around.
