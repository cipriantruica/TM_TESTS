It started on Thursday or Friday (I cannot recall which games I *did not* watch on TBS).  Deion was getting pelted with trash the whole time, it seemed.  The announcers talked about the change in the seating in the bleachers, and how that made it easier for the events that transpired.  I actually thought at the start of the Sunday slugfest that since it was a Sunday daygame the crowd would be a little different, more refined.
