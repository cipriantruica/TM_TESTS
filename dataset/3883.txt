It would be an extremely hot idea...at least with the current Alphas. The available Alphas run up to 200 MHz. But they produce quite a bit of heat. In fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat sinks. \tAlso Apple looks pretty commited to the PowerPC route instead of a deal with DEC.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t--Sid -- Sidney W.
