Vechorik)  To go one step further, you could write Roland Slabon, Pres. of the Vintage BMW Motorcycle Owners Ltd at P.O. box 67, Exeter, New Hampshire  03833 and he shall send you copy of the bimonthly rag with info as to where to send your $12 bucks if ya want to join. As far as the price of \'60 is Beemers, it varies wildly, from a low of around $1000 for an unrestored bike that still runs (like an R50 or R60) to $4500 or so for a restored R69S.  do not listen to that bull about the old bmw is not being  good  enough  to ride in todays world..
