From: strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) Subject: Re: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption   For those who did not figure it out, the below message was a reply to another in sci.crypt, for which the poster put t.p.g. in the Followup-To line. I did not notice that. Apologies to those who were confused.  The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages.  However, I do not wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yet another rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that I disagree both with the interpretation of  well-regulated  in the Second Amendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion of the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and my reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control, and disciplined, and not \'of good marksmanship\'. I think the latter a special interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference in which  well regulated  unambiguously meant \'of good marksmanship\', and not under control/disciplined, etc.  Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not an \'arming everyone\' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know many do) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular forum.  To avoid flames, or unproductive rehashings, I note that i have come in here to post this one message, just to clarify the one below. i am now outta here again though i am available via e-mail.
