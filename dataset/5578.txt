From: naccarat@eclipse.sheridanc.on.ca (Rob Naccarato) Subject: Somebody please help me!    Hello, I hope this is the right group to post this in.   i have got a little problem.  I finally managed to get a REAL operating system (Linux, as opposed to MS-Dos) and I like it alot.  But, when I try to run  istartx\', I get a strange response: My monitor goes into graphics mode and I get this big white rectangle on the screen - that is all! Nothing else!  Now, i have collected almost every FAQ in the world to help me but either it is too confusing or I must be missing something.   My setup: \t386DX (about 20Mhz) \tTrident 8900C SVGA (w/1 Meg) \t4 MB RAM \tPlenty of HD space Any help is appreciated. Thanx.
