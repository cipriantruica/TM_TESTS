From: ben@dbsm.oz.au (Benjamin Stephen Kelley) Subject: Problems with color Xterm  We have recently obtained a copy of color_xterm (from export.lcs.mit.edu) after seeing it mentioned in a previous article. On compilation, it reports the following undefined symbols: \t_get_wmShellWidgetClass \t_get_applicationShellWidgetClass  \tbut still runs. When sending escape sequences to set the colour, any colour comes out as black text on a black background. Any Ideas?  Has anyone used this program in colour successfully?  Can anyone point me to any other colour terminal emulators?  We are running OpenWindows 3 on Sun Sparcs running SunOS 4.1.3.  \t\t\t\tadvaTHANKSnce  Ben Kelley.  \t\t\t\t\t\tben@thor.dbsm.oz.au
