In Texas, you cannot carry a handgun.  Period.  Either concealed or open. And your numbers are misleading; they include suicides and accidents.  The real number from the Department of Public Safety:                     Murders, Non-neg hom\t\tCar fatalities 1991\t\t\t2651\t\t\t  3079 1992\t\t\t2240\t\t\t  3057  Texas only has  liberal  gun laws as far as purchasing a firearm; aside  from that, it is probably more restrictive than most states as far as carry goes.   >One state (do not remember which, Texas??) tried to impose a rule that you could >only buy ONE gun each MONTH. Think you all know what happened.....  The state was Virginia, and the law passed.  >I respect the right to defend yourself, but that right should not inflict on >other people.  That right only inflicts on those who threaten my rights to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, etc., in the first place.  I am not a criminal, and I do not indiscriminately fire my weapons at random.   So please explain how I am  inflicting  anything on other people.  >\tThis is not a .signature. >\tit is merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith >\tand to bring down the evil Internet.   >                        Thomas Parsli >                        thomasp@ifi.uio.no  aaron arc@cco.caltech.edu
