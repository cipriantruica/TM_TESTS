Its like leaving your lights tv, radio >and everything in the house on all of the time to me.....Nuts   Computers are a special case.. and it is a pretty good idea to  leave them on.. cuz everytime you turn on a computer, you are   putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components.   Imagine you are turning on your computer 5 or more times a day.  you are increasing the chances of damaging the chips, memory,  etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save  a few cents here and there in electricity bills, but it will not  look like much when it come time to fix your computer.  \t\t\t\t\tMy $.02 worth.. \t\t\t\t\t  N. Ngo
