These >configurations, overhead cams, etc, etc, etc, have been around >for nearly 100 years.   the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles for the orthodox inline 4, they are using a horizontally opposed 4, which is unique in that market segment.  and porsche also uses a flat six in their 911, so what is the problem?  i do not see any claim that their engine is as good as a porsche has.. they are simply pointing out that they use the same configuration as a porsche.. if you want to nitpick ad campaigns, i think there are far more blatant excesses than this.   eliot
