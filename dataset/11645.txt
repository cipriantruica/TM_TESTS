From: rob@dexter.psych.umn.edu (Robert Stephens) Subject: Compressor Problem  I have a stereo compressor-limiter by  Audio Logic (Model MT-66).  The gates work, but the compressor seems to be gone on one channel, and very weak on the other.    i shall probably need an ocsilloscope to trace it down (no pun intended), but if any one with experience with this type of equipment could point me in a certain direction as to where the  circuit is most likely to fail, i had sure appreciate it.   --  Robert C.
