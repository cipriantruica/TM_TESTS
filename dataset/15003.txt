From: mauaf@csv.warwick.ac.uk (Mr P D Simmons) Subject: Why religion and which religion?           My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas carols is about the limit for them. Thus i have never really believed in God and heaven, although I do not actually believe that they do not exist either - i am sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately i have been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but i am not used to believing things without proof - just as I cannot believe that there definitely is not a God, so I cannot definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions do not?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? is not there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they are not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and \'Loving my neighbour\' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God is attitude to people like me, who do not quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly \'good\' people. Surely not believing does not make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. i am sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.                          Thanks for the help,                                 Paul Simmons  [there is been enough discussion about evidence for Christianity recently that you may prefer to respond to this via email rather than as a posting.  --clh]
