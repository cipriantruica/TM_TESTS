Sold through Buick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly).  I believe it was in \'72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts were not interchangeable with the older models.  Parts are thus much harder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are not too difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff including a brand new (not remfg) long block.  Either a GT or a Kharman Ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.  Mark
