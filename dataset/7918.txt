On my friend is jetski, bars turn left to go left.  Anyway, all you are doing there is changing the yaw of the jets, so the relationship between the handlbars and the rear-mounted jets is completely arbitrary (simple linkage could make it work either way).  >so this supports the move-the-contact-patch-from-beneath-the >centre-of-mass theory on how to *lean*. This contradicts the need for >gyroscopic precession to have a countersteering induced *lean*.  It seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion than snow skis.  But it *has* been an amusing digression.  Hey Ed, how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horse is reins left to go left?  :-)  Or am I confusing two threads here?
