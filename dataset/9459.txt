Ah, so you finally found a use for that super slo-mo and frame advance other than scrutinizing  Sorority Babes in Heat . Congrats!   >I wish I had FILMS instead of tapes, preferably at 48fps rather than 24, >but while i am at it, i had like to have ten million dollars, and be able >to eat anything I want and never gain any weight, either.    Trust me, you had have a helluva time manipulating them. Besides, if you converted the film to video you had have all kinds of artifacts because of the difference in frame rate (unless you are an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for a laserdisc company or something).   >Gary is list of the ten slowest bats in baseball:    Hey, no fair! What about \'Fettucine\' Alfredo Griffin? The guy practically has to pivot the bat around along with his body.   >Gary is list of  How the HELL can he hit like that?  > >1.  Julio Franco >2.  Phil Plantier >9.  Darren Daulton    Daulton does not strike me as all that strange. he has a little bit quiet at  the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I did not think *anyone* could hit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes contact, it is *solid*. he has got good power to all fields and rarely is he caught not ready for a pitch.     I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to practice his swing while \'on the throne\'? :-) Sure looks like it :-)     How \'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front foot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot out of his hips.   >Gary is list of  i had give Dave Kirsch is kidneys to have a swing like that.     Well, they are already spoken for (by several people), but ..     i had add Robbie Alomar is name to the list, among others. I really like Dean Palmer is swing, for some twisted reason, as well as Pedro Munoz is swing.   >that is all for now.  i am looking at Derrick May is tapes tonight, along >with Troy Neel is.  That guy is a serious ox.    A thought about May: It looks like they have taught him to turn on the ball. IMHO, he has going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling off the ball to the point that he has going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders low and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left  and left-center, IMHO you are going to see a good number of weak grounders to  the right side of the infield in the next month.   --  Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in \'93  kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!
