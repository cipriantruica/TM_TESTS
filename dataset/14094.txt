I would not expect there to be anything block >our view of them either.  What am I missing?  you are assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface into sunlight.  Not so.  Even on Earth, each pole gets several weeks without sunlight in mid-winter.  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial tilt and a much longer orbit.  Pluto is north pole, for example, gets over a century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light.  At the moment, we are in luck -- Pluto and Charon are just past their equinox, when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles (of each). If we get probes there soon, only the immediate vicinity of one pole (on each) will be in long-term shadow.  This will get steadily worse the longer we wait. --  All work is one man is work.             | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
