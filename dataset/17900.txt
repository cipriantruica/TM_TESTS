From: demon@desire.wright.edu (Not a Boomer) Subject: A few questions for Janet Reno  \tA few questions for Janet Reno:  \tWhy do not you think generals have any place in law enforcement?  \tIf the ATF/FBI had proof that Koresh was:  \t\tA child molester \t\tA child abuser \t\tA wife abuser \t\tBigamist \t\tSexual Deviant (not a crime in all 50 states, yet) \tAs well as \t\tIllegally modify weapons  \tWhy was not he simply arrested during one of his morning jogs?  Why did the allegations of child/wife/sex crimes only come out after the Branch Davidians repelled the initial assualt?  \tWas it because it became necessary to demonize David Koresh?  Do you feel responsible for the deaths of over 80 people?  How many would be alive to day if Koresh had been arrested outside the compound?   \tInquiring minds want to know.  \t[Although Janet was installed after the siege began, her purge of the justice dept. leaves only her people in charge.]  Brett ________________________________________________________________________________ \t there is nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an intellectual conviction.
