Yes, yes, I know Motorola HTs are bullet-proof, unbreakable, plutonium-based  indestructable -- you can drive a tank over them and they will still work.  But just how often does that come up?  Why are hams willing (and they *are*) to spend the price of a synthaszied dual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig???  Note: this is not a flame; as I said, i am sure this is a good deal for this rig. i am just amazed that it *is* a good deal.  I would have guessed that a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual- bander to a ham, no matter how durable. Just shows you how wrong *I* can be.
