No, Caleb, it is not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with; it is superb, whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN left off when hockey went to SC (this is excepting SC is use of feeds from CBC (-;).  it is the amount of hockey they are showing, or lack of it, that we are complaining about.  They had rights to two OT is that could have been shown on Sunday night after baseball ... and they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed by Super-8 home movies of old car races (yes, I was checking in desperation for Canucks-Jets) last night after SportsCenter.  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.
