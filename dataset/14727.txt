From: dhawk@netcom.com (David Hawkins) Subject: Need Help with  They came for the Jews  quote  Years ago I grabbed the following from the net - maybe from this newsgroup.  Does anyone know of a source for whether this is an accurate quote?   Thanks!  Bartletts leaves out the homosexual lines, but they were one of the groups the Nazis tried to exterminate. === In Germany, they first came for the communists, and I did not speak up because I was not a communist. Then they came for the jews, and I did not speak up because I was not a jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak up because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the homosexuals, and I did not speak up because I was not a homosexual. Then they came for the catholics, and I did not speak up because I was a protestant. Then they came for me --- but by that time there was no one left to speak up.                                      -- Pastor Martin Neimoller
