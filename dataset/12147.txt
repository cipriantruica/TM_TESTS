From: klink@cbnewsl.cb.att.com (steven.r.klinkner) Subject: Beginner is RF ???  Can anybody recommend a good, application-oriented beginner is reference to RF circuits?    I am pretty good on theory & know what different types of modulation mean,  but do not have a lot of practical experience.  A book detailing working circuits of different types (modulation, power, frequency, what is legal, what is not, et cetera), would be very helpful.  Thanks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Klinkner                AT&T Bell Labs               srk@boeing.att.com                                                            att!boeing!srk     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
