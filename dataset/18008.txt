The number of people showing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace.  I doubt that it constitutes more than a handful of us.  i am queer, and I will not be there, simply because I do not have the time or the transportation.  What the hell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum number?  Face it, people, we are everywhere.  There are always more of us than you think.  Our numbers are constantly GROWING, not diminishing...some of your children will grow up to join us.  Hell, some of MY children may grow up to join us.  The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and blind yourself to it, but to realize that you have nothing to fear.  we are not perverts, we are not dangerous, we are just here, and we are human just like you--er, most of you.  Idiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like.  It will not do them one iota of good.  Drewcifer  P.S.  I still cannot get over the fact that some people actually believe that every queer in the U.S. would show up at the MOW, and that these numbers are meaningful.  And, come to think of it, what about those of us in OTHER countries?  Tree.  --  ----bi    Andrew D.
