Personality means something to me.  That is exactly why I like Clement (and Emrick).  On the other hand, JD is a pompous, bull-headed, arrogant know-it-all.  he has a real turn-off (which is exactly what I do when he has on).  One complaint I do have about Clement is that he sometimes talks too much.  If I wanted that i had listen to Tim McGarver doing a baseball game.  Mom.
