From: bentz@blustone.uucp (Ray Bentz) Subject: SPARC IPC Sprite goes off screen  Environment: \tX11R4 \tMotif 1.1.4 \tSun IPC 4.1.3  Problem: \tWhen mouse is moved across screen horizontally, the sprite goes off \tof the edge of the screen and reappears at the *other* edge. \tIt appears that the server thinks we are running in multi-screen \tmode; the cursor seems to  wrap  from one side of the screen to \tthe other. \tAs far as we can tell, we are not running the server in multi-screen \tmode.  Please reply via E-mail.  --  Ray Bentz                            Phone: (609)727-4600 Bluestone Consulting, Inc.
