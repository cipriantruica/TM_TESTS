While the EC working rules are more liberal than what we have in the 1989 US-Canada FTA, there is probably a law about that (having health insurance coverage is a condition of my being down here, for example).  You have mentioned this once before, yet both the NY Times profile on the German sickness funds (late Jan.) and pamphlets that my girlfriend gives to her language students from the German consulate both say that it is  voluntary  (okay, there were quotation marks (-;) and that only 90% of the population is covered by the sickness funds (analogous to our provincial health insurances, but not divided by province/state).
