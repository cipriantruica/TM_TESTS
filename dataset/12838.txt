I have not even seen anything anecdotal on it.  Given how common they are eaten - do you know any child or adolescent who *does not* eat the stuff? - I think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now. Also, there is nothing weird in those cereals.  As far as the brain is concerned (except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as galactosemia), sugar is sugar, regardless if it is coated on cereal, sprinkled onto cereal, or dissolved in soda, coffee or whatever.  There was some interest a few years ago in aspartame lowering seizure thresholds, but I do not believe anything ever came of it. ---  . SLMR 2.1 .
