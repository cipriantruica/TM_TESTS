Did you see Mike Lupica is column in Sunday is news?  My sentiments exactly.  I think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire into their hearts next season.  Either that or he has going to  be kicking alot of butt!  >Reading through most of these hockey news I do not see many Ranger fans writing.     i am here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly quiet (you know, doing the  lurking  thing).  I do not have a sense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either.  I  am a die-hard Ranger fan (I guess I have to be - I sat in the Garden throughout the Penguins\' - led by Mario is 5 goals - decimation  of them on 4/9), but am sick at the abundance of talent that has been totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this season.  > >I have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that last >dreadful stretch. > >1. Knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline, why did not we see Mike >Hurlbut, who played pretty well when he was called up when Leetch first went >down? >  Hurlbut was injured for quite a while.  i am not sure, but I think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run, and if so, like you, question why he was not used.  > >>2. Why????!!!!! is Joe Kocur playing every night?  He is not Bob Probert who is >>tough but also can play. >>  I believe Kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation  factor.  Granted, he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for  that reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is not doing any REAL physical intimidation (i had like to have a nickel  for every time J.D. said \'they have got to take the body more\'),  you have got to at least have some illusions ;-(  >3. How come Paul Broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of the >season.  At least he plays with some heart and character, draws penalties and >plays 110% when he has on the ice.  Was he in the doghouse for some reason?  I agree and I do not know.  >4. Joe Cirella?????!!!!  Enough said! >  Sorry, I do not agree with you here.  I think Joey C. did a good job filling in when he was asked to.  I cannot imagine that it is easy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer.  I do not seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too much, or failing to clear the zone.  He worked hard, and at least did not make any rookie mistakes.  As he said himself in an interview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.    > >Ranger fans may be suffering but we are some of the most loyal, unlike Islander >fans who only show up when the team wins. >  Absolutely.  I think attendance at the Garden was better on the last day of the season, than any average night for the Islanders.  >  >>fought series.  Mario is amazing! >  The man is awesome.  In a way, i am enjoying the playoffs more, now that the Rangers are not in them.  I can really appreciate all the glory Mario is getting without \'hating\' him because he has on the opposing team.  He deserves it all, as far as i am concerned.  \t\t- Mary  =============================================================== Mary Blumenstock               mblumens@itsmail1.hamilton.edu Hamilton College  Clinton, N.Y.
