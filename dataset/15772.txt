Are you sure about this? i am currently looking at a copy of last  Thursday is SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders ad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that, but there is a part in the middle which rather prominently says  WANTED: We pay cash for assault rifles and pistols. . Granted, I have not seen today is paper yet. But i had be surprised if there was not a Traders ad in it. it is probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers) anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.  By the way, let me put in a plug for Traders. I have shopped all over the SF Bay Area and I have never seen another store with lower prices. And their selection is amazing.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Lee Gaucher                         |   My opinions. gaucher@sam.cchem.berkeley.edu      |   No one else is. ---------------------------------------------------------------------
