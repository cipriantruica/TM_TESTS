From: belvilad@dunx1.ocs.drexel.edu (A. Belville) Subject: Circuit List (locations)   \tHere is a list I get when I was combing through some microfilm one day here at Drexel while completely board.  Most of these circuits are pretty easy to constuct and can be done by a novice. \tThis is basically some stuff that could prove useful to you without having to sit down and either design or buy the stuff (not a good word, but i am tired right now). \tHope you enjoy!  \tIf you have any additions send them to me and i shall add them to the list .  They do not have to be from this particular magazine, they just have to be interesting!  \tRADIO ELECTRONICS  Year\tMonth\tPage\tArticle Name and/or discription ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92\tApril\t31\tCar Audio Amplifier (270 Watts) \tMay\t41\tMidi Light Controller (Light control from music input) \t\t47\tSolid State Relay  \t\t50\tDigital Altimeter \tJune\t53\tElectronic Thermostat 91\tFebruary43\tAudio Sweep/Marker Generator (frequency response) \tApril\t43\tLine Power from 12 volts (12 VDC -> 110 VAC) (40 Watts) \tJune \t39\tElectronic Compass \tAugust\t55\tSpeaker Protector \tSept.\t33\tSolid State Tesla Coil \tOct.\t39\tVocal Effects/Mixer \tNov.\t58\tMusic on Hold (Play music for someone who is on hold on \t\t\t\tthe phone) \tDec.\t47\tTHD Analizer \t\t53\tBattery Tool \t\t63\tElectronic Fuse 90\tJan.\t35\tAcoustic field Generator \t\t45\tPhone activated Audio Muting circuit \tFeb.\t31\tFrequency Probe \t\t37\tRadar Detector Tester \tMarch\t31\tUniversal Laboratory Power Supply \tApril \t33\tMorse/RTTY Detector \t\t43 \tCapacitance Adaptor (Capacitance add on for a DMM) \t\t46\tSolid State Wiper control \tMay\t37 \tUniversal Descrambler (for a TV) \tJuly\t31 \tDigital Dashboard (for a car) \tAugust\t41\tDigital Pressure gauge \tSept.\t33\tVocal Stripper (take the vocals away from music) \tOct.\t37\tRocket Altimeter (model rockets) \tDec.\t33\tBenchtop Frequency counter 89\tJan\t55\tCarrier-Current Audio transmitter (audio through your \t\t\t\thouse is wiring) \t\t62 \tPlasma display globe \t\t70 \tAdvanced Control System \tFeb.\t55\tCarrier-Current Receiver \tMarch\t51\tHi-Fi Audio Amp for House or Car (High Power) \tMay\t41\tI-R Extender (extender for Infra-Red remotes) \tJuly\t31 \tLight beam communication \t\t38\tDigital Capacitance meter \tNov\t39 \tR-C Decade Box  \t\t43\tDigital Compass \tDec\t37\tProgrammable Phasor Property Guard 88\tJuly\t41 \tL-C Meter Part 1 \tAugust 50\tL-C Meter Part 2 87\tNov.\t107\tElectronic Combonation Lock 86\tSept\t41\tStun Gun \tJune\t55\tClick and Pop filter for your stereo (removes clicks and \t\t\t\tpops when you play old LPs)  -- From what I could see, you can order the circuit kits, finished or unfinished \tor you can order the parts that you cannot get through a normal store  _______________________________________________________________________________ Andy Belville                          || it is taken me a long time, but i have belvilad@dunx1.ocs.drexel.edu          || fallen in Love with a beautiful woman. _______________________________________________________________________________
