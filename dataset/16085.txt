What is  doing it right the first time ?  Murdered them all?  Used tanks?  Maybe they should have had enough evidence to indict.  From the list presented to date, I have not seen ANYTHING illegal.  They claim that the BD is bought components to convert their weapons to Class III devices, but no evidence that they had done so.  In fact, with a Class III FFL living with them, this may have been legal (given recent court rulings).  What you really meant to say was that the ATF should have done the right and lwaful thing.  Or did you just want the BD is dead? -- Dillon Pyron                      | The opinions expressed are those of the TI/DSEG Lewisville VAX Support    | sender unless otherwise stated.
