Seems he did not understand anything about realities, liar, lunatic or the real thing is a very narrow view of the possibilities of Jesus message.

So anyone that thinks the possibilities with Jesus is bound to the classical Lewis notion of \'liar, lunatic or saint\' is indeed bound to become a Christian.
