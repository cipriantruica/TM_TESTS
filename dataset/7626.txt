The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer   probably does not know exactly what it will be until all the factory    kick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume   at the end of the month/quarter/whatever. It might be a funny munber but   it is all you have to start with, except the sticker, and anyone who pays   sticker price is really being ripped off.  Mark
