As for the picks Ottawa picks   which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will  go  . he shall either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.  IMO I would take Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in the World Championships.  Daigle did not show this for his junior team.  San Jose will then get Kariya.  Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov (I think that is it) or a      defenseman Rob Niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)  Because of expansion I will not go further but I will name other of the blue chip prospects     - Chris Gratton    - Chris Pridham    - a swedish player who I cannot remember his name  Draft Order ----------- 1) Ottawa 2) San Jose 3) Tampa Bay 4) South Florida or Anahiem 5) South Florida or Anahiem 6) Hartford 7) Edmonton 8) Dallas 9) NY Rangers 10) Philadelphia  the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - I do not have the standings here and am guessing   (In my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with Kariya   leading the way but not going    Shawn - GO CAPS (two first round picks for the next three years - THANKS                  ST.LOUIS or should I say RON CARON and SCOTT STEVENS)
