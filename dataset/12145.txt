From: baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca (baden de bari) Subject: _Exhausted student needing HELP!          Well, i have now been working on this DAMNED stepper controller board  since 9pm.  it is now 6am... i am pissed off.  Period.  Alright, I can  drive the steppers through the 3479P is; no problem (that is with the  6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines).  Problem  1:  i have got some 4 wire steppers.  I put the darkest line to + and the  other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda.  Tried it with a printer stepper  (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), did not work too well.  It  would  shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?)  Also i have  been  trying to get a bunch of NPN is to work with it... NO LUCK... tried  PNP is,  still NO LUCK!!!  I do not know if i am cursed on this or what, but I feel  my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER ... ARGGG!!!          I do not know what is wrong with the transistor hook-up (to-220  pkg  type), also tryed the 2n2222-pkg type... no luck.                           i am going to try getting some z is, and I hope  you  can help me with this problem.    If someone can please help me with this soon, it would be greatly    appreciated...                   Thanks.         _________________________________________________   Inspiration  |   ___                             |   comes to     |      o  baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca |   those who    | (  ^  ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca |   seek the     |   /-       =] Baden de Bari [=    |   unknown.     |                                   |   -------------------------------------------------    l
