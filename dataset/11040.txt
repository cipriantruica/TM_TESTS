Especially when you are seeing >tens, nay dozens, of people on usenet agreeing with you.  The people on usenet are clearly a special bunch.  We live the net, which is the future of our culture.  Usenetters have rapid electronic access to information.  Society in general must depend on CNN.    I can only hope we can make this information accessable by the public before the radical fringe, which _is_ the majority, destroys the fabric of this country.  Freedom is never easily won.  -Thomas
