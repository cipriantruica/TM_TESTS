It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret.  If it were published, one could then build physically identical clone versions of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips.  But the cloner would not provide the keys to the escrow houses.  Hmmn.  Or is there a technical hack that i have missed?  E.g. how about if the chips were made unprogrammed but serialized, and then shipped to the two escrow houses who programmed in their halves of the keys, but in a way that requires that secret keys known only to the escrow houses be installed as well, without which clone versions would not interoperate?  This is getting awfully complicated, but that is crypto for you.  --  John R.
