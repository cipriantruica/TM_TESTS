No, and in fact, that was Ferreira is original strategy, which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement. There was not exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he has going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks, my guess is that it was not as good in practice as it was on paper, and he has tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we had not had those injuries, and whether we are complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar.  >Of course, Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal >contributions before he was fired, so it is not clear that this would have >been different.  Besides, they *were* marginal contributors.  let us also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly Kisio, which, if the rumors i have heard are true, was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.  Imagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine had not jammed.  >With or without Mullen, they were not going to be a playoff team; what good >does it do them to hang onto a player who had rather be elsewhere?    Especially an unhappy player that is not playing as well because of it. Not that i had accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply was not there, and that kind of thing can affect the team.  >>An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis >>but not kept, because of his age.

But >>you have to find the right balance.  >Right balance for what?  that is the issue.    Exactly. At the time they let Skriko go, we had not yet had the major injury bugs that killed us later. i had much rather have Skriko around than someone like Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that was not the choice. And since the choice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the right choice was made for that time period.  --   Chuq  IMHO  Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com    Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ    Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)   San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)
