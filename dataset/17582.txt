And, as has been noted more times than we care to count, about as  likely to stand up in court as the twenty-seven eight by ten  color glossy pictures the Stockbridge, Mass., police, took for  use as evidence against Arlo Guthrie.  (As anyone who knows  Alice is Restaurant is aware, he pleaded guilty to littering, was  fined $50, and told to pick up the garbage.)  \t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Reitman  HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED  One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees  jointly, as  tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the  survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the  said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights  and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof  at the death of the other.   The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a  joint tenancy.  Germain v. Delaine, 294 Ala. 443, 318 So.2d 681 (1975).
