From: dtate+@pitt.edu (David M. Tate) Subject: MVP \'92 Revisited  Tim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year is Defensive Average stats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive performances, compared to league average.  i have combined those with my position-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total run values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the MVP award.  Major caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if San Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are position-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still do not know what to do about catchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions  of Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.    Having said that, there are still some surprises.  let us look National League first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.  \tPlayer\t\tOffense\t\tDefense\t\tTotal  \tSandberg\t  44\t\t  32\t\t 76 \tBonds\t\t  67\t\t   3\t\t 70 \tWalker\t\t  26\t\t  26\t\t 52 \tJustice\t\t  14\t\t  33\t\t 47 \tDaulton\t \t  44\t\t  ??\t\t 44+? \tLarkin\t\t  36\t\t   4\t\t 40 \tGrace\t\t  13\t\t  27\t\t 40  As I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season. If you deflate Sandberg is offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you get essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it would not have been close, but that apparently was not the case.  Darren Daulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference, and I could not tell you whether that is easy or impossible.  A good case  could be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.  My personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.   In the American League:  \tPlayer\t\tOffense\t\tDefense\t\tTotal  \tVentura\t\t  22\t\t  34\t\t 56 \tMartinez\t  47\t\t  -1\t\t 46 \tB. Anderson \t  21\t\t  25\t\t 46 \tThomas\t\t  47\t\t  -5\t\t 42 \tR. Henderson\t  25\t\t  16\t\t 41 \tRaines\t\t  17\t\t  23\t\t 40 \tTettleton\t  33\t\t  ??\t\t 33+?  OK, let us see a show of hands: how many of you picked Robin Ventura as top player in the AL last year?  I certainly did not, but i had have a hard time arguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are only approximate, but that is a big gap between him and the   guy.  Also, those of you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.  Once again, there is a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as important as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke a guess, folks; I do not think we can do any better than that.  My personal vote (excluding pitchers):  \tVentura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.  i am a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher leverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense.  For the record:  \tCarlos Baerga\t\t  27\t\t  5\t\t  32 \tRoberto Alomar\t\t  35\t\t -2\t\t  33  Forget it; it is a wash.  Let me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding Don Mattingly is defense this past season.  Don recovered brilliantly from his weak \'90 and \'91 to end up with  \tMattingly\t\t  -1\t\t  17\t\t  16 runs  which is clearly an above-average first baseman.  However, it is still 18 runs behind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John Olerud.  On the other hand, it is ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, and every other AL first baseman not yet mentioned.  --     David M.
