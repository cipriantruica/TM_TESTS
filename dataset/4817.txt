Would if only it were true ...  If only MIT would fix the !@&$^*@ twm  InstallWindowColormaps()  crash bug once and for all, then I could say that i have (almost) unable to crash either  twm  or  tvtwm , which would be a remarkable feat - and most desirable to boot.  I mean, this bug has only been reported, oh, a zillion times by now ...  Now *servers*, on the other hand ... (want to crash an OpenWindows 3.0  xnews  server at will?
