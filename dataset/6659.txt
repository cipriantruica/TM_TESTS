From: tjo@scr.siemens.com (Tom Ostrand) Subject: Radio for Toyota Tercel  i am looking for a replacement radio/tape player for a 1984  Toyota Tercel.  Standard off-the-shelf unit is fine, but  every place i have gone to (Service Merchandise, etc.) does not  have my car in its model application book.  I want to just  take out the old radio, and slide in the new, with minimal time spent hooking it up and adjusting the dashboard.  If you have put in a new unit in a similar car, i had like to hear what brand,  how easy it was to do the change, and any other  relevant information.   Please answer via E-mail. Thanks,  Tom Ostrand  --  Tom Ostrand\t\t\tE-mail:  tjo@scr.siemens.com Siemens Corporate Research\tPhone:   609-734-6569 755 College Road East\t\tFAX:     609-734-6565 Princeton, NJ  08540-6668
