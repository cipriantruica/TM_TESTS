Oh, this is excellent.  That was hardly the point, was it? I was commenting on this all-too-common Republican attitude that if people disagree with us, they must be idiots, they must be sheep being led around by the Evil Liberal Media Conspiracy. This is a dangerous attitude indeed. Because it is not a very big step from  people are sheep, they cannot think for themselves  to  people are sheep and need firm leadership from we, who know better ... this sort of attitude makes me worry about what will happen to the United States if the extremist wing of the Republican party ever gets back into power again.  >      Holy christ! :)  Hey!

Broward: (silence)  >    Want some more  free predictions  ?  OK, I predict that in 1996 the Republicans will STILL be bitter. Yeah, yeah, I know, it is not very impressive to predict things that are inevitable...      ...so I propose that we destroy the moon, neatly solving that problem.
