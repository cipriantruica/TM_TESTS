In the Dallas area, I just bought a can (it is for my best friend is bike... a 1986 XLH883, mines got a belt hahahahaha!!!) for $6.79 ($7.35 with tax) at Bates Discount Cycle Parts on the southbound I-35E service road in Farmers Branch just a couple miles north of the I-635/I-35E interchange. They have about a dozen cans left.  --  ============================================================================= Neal Howard   \'91 XLH-1200      DoD        CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX) \t      doh     |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org \t      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac is.
