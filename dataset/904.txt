And is it as easy to use as 3D Studio? Can it just do a render as fast as 3DS if you do not want things like IOR etc.. 3DS can do fine shadows, animated reflection maps, animated bump maps, animated anything maps, and with the IPAS routines  (Not that i have ever seen them) It can do explosions, top quality morphing, fire, rain, lens flares etc.. i am not knocking imagine, I just want to know how it compares with 3DS
