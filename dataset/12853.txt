This physician has diagnosed a problem, even though he probably has never seen the diagnosed disease before and has no idea of what kinds of problems can present similar symptoms.  This physician now wants to treat his first case of this disease without any help from the medical community.  The best thing Ming-zhou Liu could do is fire his current physician and seek out a better one.  Russell
