It was implied in the first technical posting by Dorothy Denning that the FBI would do the decryption *for* the law enforcement agencies.  It was not clear to me from the post whether this would be done in realtime or not, or whether the FBI would just decrypt the session keys for the locals, or would do the whole message.      One thing i am a bit puzzled by:  Why are not they doing this with a public key scheme of some sort?  You could generate two uniqe public/private pairsor for each chip.  Then, escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies.  Set the protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys.  To decrypt a message, both escrow agencies (in the right order, for most PK schemes) have to decrypt with the escrowed private key.  This way, there would not be thecconcern that, once the police had asked fo  a warrant/wiretap, they would have your key forver.      --John Kelsey
