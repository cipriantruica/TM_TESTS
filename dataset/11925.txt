Here is something I posted about this a few years ago.  it is not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer is synonyms):  ------ In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility):  74\tThe original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively \tobsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball \tfunctions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.  74H\tModification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher \tpower consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.  74L\tModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed. \tVery obsolete; use CMOS.  74S\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in \tpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.  74LS\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower \tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of \tdevices.  74F\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high \tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.  74AS\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things \tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly \tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with \t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer \tCMOS 74 families.  4000\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS \tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low \tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast. \tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity, \tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too). \tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The \tclear choice when speed is not important.  74HC\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power \tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for \tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability. \tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of \tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power \tconsumption at faster speeds.  74HCT\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read \tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility \tin CMOS involves some compromises.  10K\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources \tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for \tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow \tthe rules or it will not work.  Availability to hobbyists limited, \tcan be expensive.  100K\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and \tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I have not used either significantly yet. --  All work is one man is work.             | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
