How do you claim arab-americans had no involvement in the WTC bombing?  \tOk, his involvement is alleged by the FBI, which does not seem to reliable these days.  But honestly, there is a pile of evidence pointing to them, and it seems those 5 were involved.  \tThis does not mean that all arab-americans were involved, nor should they be blamed for it, but denying that there were some arab-americans involved sounds sorta silly to me.
