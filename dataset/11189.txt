First of all, the chip does not do that.  It runs at 16 megabits/second, which is far beyond what you need for voice.  it is obviously intended for data as well, and on high-speed lines at that.  Second -- what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone? I do not care how fancy that chip is; it is not as fancy as the roomful of analyzers at Fort Meade running the program they will have 5 years from now.  They cannot update every Clipper chip that is out there.  Third -- if they did do this preprocessing in the chip, it would probably have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns.  If nothing else, that would hurt the acceptability of the product.  The V.32bis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly- massaged voice as is; add any more to the mix, and you are completely out of the ballpark.
