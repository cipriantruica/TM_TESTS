In article  jim@specialix.com (Jim Maurer) responds:  \tWhy do not you contribute to a group helping the \thomeless if you so concerned?   In article  Jack Schmidling (arf@genesis.MCS.COM) reveals the true depths of his cynicism:  \tI do (did) contribute to the ARF mortgage fund but \twhen interest rates plumetted, I just paid it off.  \tThe problem is, I could not convince Congress to move \tmy home to a nicer location on Federal land.   In other words, Mr. Schmidling could care less for the plight of the homeless, but is not above using them to score points for his agenda.  Harry Katz
