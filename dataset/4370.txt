From: umcarls9@ccu.umanitoba.ca (Charles Carlson) Subject: what is needed for CD ROM on a mac?   Does System 7.X support all SCSI CD ROM drives?  Or are specific drivers needed for each different make/model?  Specifically, i am looking at getting a NEC CDR-25, mainly because they are cheap.  I know its a slow drive, but multimedia is not my interest. I mainly want it for extracting software distributed on CD. Will I need to get a specific driver to use this drive on a Mac?   thanks...Charles   --  / Charles Carlson  umcarls9@ccu.Umanitoba.CA     Warning: This article contains flammable material that may ignite without / prior notice.
