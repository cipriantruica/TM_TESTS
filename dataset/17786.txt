From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (Clinton/Gore \'92) Subject: CLINTON: AM Press Briefing by Dee Dee Myers -- 4.15.93                                 THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                  April 15, 1993                               PRESS BRIEFING                            BY DEE DEE MYERS  \t                                The Briefing Room   9:45 A.M. EDT  \t     \t   \t     Q\t  Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?  \t     \t   \t     MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he shall meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he shall have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he shall meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he shall do his weekly photos with the  various groups. \t      \t     Q\t  A photo op with Vessey? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  there is no coverage on the Vessey meeting. \t      \t     Q\t  Why? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Why?  it is a closed meeting.   \t      \t     Q\t  What about the lunch? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there is no coverage. \t      \t     Q\t  Is he meeting with any congress people today? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled. \t      \t     Q\t  There are no meetings -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no. \t      \t     Q\t  Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  it is high on the agenda on something that they will  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President has not  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it is  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first. \t      \t     Q\t  Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole. \t      \t     Q\t  How many times? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night. \t      \t     Q\t  What was the outcome of that? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  they are continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package. \t      \t     Q\t  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we are hopeful that we are going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we will  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement. \t      \t     Q\t  Did they discuss the VAT tax? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not know if that came up. \t      \t     Q\t  Can you check that? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  \t     Q\t  So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he has trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he has trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it is important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we will let you know.  But at the  moment, he has continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole. \t      \t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody else? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday. \t      \t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody today? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not think anything is scheduled, but I  would not rule it out. \t      \t     Q\t  We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both. \t      \t     Q\t  In the President is mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I cannot talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo. \t      \t     Q\t  But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we are still hopeful that we will get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress. \t      \t     Q\t  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  he has discussing options with him. \t      \t     Q\t  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package. \t      \t     Q\t  But specifically, that you have lost Democrats other  than Shelby? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe so.  There has not been a  vote. \t      \t     Q\t  What about Kohl? \t      \t     Q\t  Kohl and Feingold? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  There has not been a vote yet.  And we will  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package. \t      \t     Q\t  If you are were not worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package does not pass. \t      \t     Q\t  No Democrats.  (Laughter.) \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i shall let you draw your own conclusions. \t      \t     Q\t  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  there is nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I would not rule it out. \t      \t     Q\t  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  What we have done is we are in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it is entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we will send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package. \t      \t     Q\t  Will you share those with us? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you have copies of the ones you sent -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, since yesterday is questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I do not think we have anything to add  to that. \t      \t     Q\t  But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- i am not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I do not  think he said he was directly contacted by them. \t      \t     Q\t  Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think there is been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I do not think  I want to add to that. \t      \t     Q\t  In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  they are  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President is health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I do not have anything to add. \t      \t     Q\t  You have not answered the question.  It was not being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President is  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing. \t      \t     Q\t  And then suddenly -- \t      \t     Q\t  What happened?  \t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.  \t     Q\t  But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?  \t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  has not been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they are looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.  \t     Q\t  And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.  \t     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they have taken that mandate seriously and they are  considering all options.  \t     Q\t  But that is not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.   \t     Q\t   If it changes i shall tell you.  \t      \t     Q\t  Bring him on.  \t     Q\t  And you repeatedly referred to the President is  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.) \t      \t     Q\t  But that is what Alice Rivlin is comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --  \t     MS. MYERS:  I would not -- no, Alice Rivlin is not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it is something that is being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I do not have anything to add to that.  \t     Q\t  Is it because he has very few options?  \t     Q\t  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it is now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?    \t     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group is mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he has not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it is something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.  \t     Q\t  They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?  \t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?  \t     MS. MYERS:  it is simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they are looking at is the VAT.   \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?  \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I do not know.  \t     Q\t  Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?  \t     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President is  comments.  \t     Q\t  Have they discovered that the sin taxes will not raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?  \t     MS. MYERS:  No, there is no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan. \t      \t     Q\t  i am asking whether the projections -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  there is a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You cannot decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you cannot discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.  \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, we have been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.  \t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.    \t     Q\t  The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.  \t     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we are  not going to answer until -- there is a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.   \t      \t     Q\t  And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Correct. \t      \t     Q\t     they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they are not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings. \t      \t     Q\t  Well, you have. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he has not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement. \t      \t     Q\t  No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Correct. \t      \t     Q\t  That does not mean he has not heard about it. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i am not going to get into the details of  what is discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself. \t      \t     Q\t     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he has not  looked at it, do you mean that he has not looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or has not looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it is something that he has thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What i am saying is that in the process  of the working groups it is something that he has not considered yet.   it is something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And i am not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed. \t      \t     Q\t  it is your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  That is correct. \t      \t     Q\t  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George is statement in March that this will not be in the proposal? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what is already been said. \t      \t     Q\t  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i am not going to comment any further on what  might happen if. \t      \t     Q\t  But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you had exclude food and energy -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i am not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that has not been made. \t      \t     Q\t  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala is  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not know specifically what -- \t      \t     Q\t  Could you check for us, because that is a real  important credibility question? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Sure. \t      \t     Q\t  Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you have been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think we have said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add. \t      \t     Q\t  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we are asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it is a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever. \t      \t     Q\t  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  we are not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  i have said what I have to say about  this issue. \t      \t     Q\t  All we were trying to find out -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you are trying to find out  and i have given you the answers, Helen. \t      \t     Q\t  we are trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  that is the -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.   \t      \t     Q\t  Yes, but it was not an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they are obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on. \t      \t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table in February. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  they will  present it to the President at some point and he shall make a decision. \t      \t     Q\t  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is clearly on the table.  \t      \t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is back on the table, Bill. \t      \t     Q\t  Did he change his mind? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he has not made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it is on the table.  it is  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we will let you know. \t      \t     Q\t  So he must have changed his mind, right? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  -- \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, there is like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they are authority  exceeds the President is. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they have done that. \t      \t     Q\t  Are you going to put out his income tax? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.  \t      \t     Q\t  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing is planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions. \t      \t     Q\t  we are used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i have seen those briefings.  (Laughter.) \t      \t     Q\t  Could we have one? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:   No, I do not think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it. \t      \t     Q\t  Did they file a joint form? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Yes. \t      \t     Q\t  When did he file it? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it is being filed today. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting. \t      \t     Q\t  No backgrounder today? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today. \t      \t     Q\t  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.) \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  We cannot give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it is too confusing.  (Laughter.) \t      \t     Q\t  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   they have both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  there is been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we would consider -- \t      \t     Q\t  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  they are people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they have  initiated.  But there is been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we are considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs do not come back to the negotiating table, if they do not sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we have been saying regularly. \t      \t     Q\t  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  we are continuing to put pressure on them  every day. \t      \t     Q\t  Which does not work so -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   we are going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.   \t      \t     Q\t  You say it is having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i had be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that. \t      \t     Q\t  there is been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they have had effect in Serbia  and we think they have had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, i shall be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you had like. \t      \t     Q\t  We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we have not  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you. \t      \t     Q\t  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  we will have to work with Congress on the  details of that package. \t      \t     Q\t  So that would be new money that you would hope to  get? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that is new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher. \t      \t     Q\t  is not there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you did not want to do that. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal \'93 budget.  What we are looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we are going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen. \t      \t     Q\t  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward. \t      \t     Q\t  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress. \t      \t     Q\t  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President is jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do. \t      \t     Q\t  Who are they? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations. \t      \t     Q\t  Will the FBI chief be there? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No. \t      \t     Q\t  Or any other federal law enforcement officials? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders. \t      \t     Q\t  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that is in the FY \'94 budget for disarmament? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate. \t      \t     Q\t  So this would be the $700 million that is in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget. \t      \t     Q\t  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal \'94 -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  we will work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for. \t      \t     Q\t  This $1.8 billion on top of -- \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier. \t      \t     Q\t  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Correct. \t      \t     Q\t  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow. \t      \t     Q\t  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you are getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  that is an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that is interesting.  But no, we are thrilled  by the support we have received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we will continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives. \t      \t     Q\t  what is the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is on his calendar.  I think he shall almost  certainly go. \t      \t     Q\t  All three days? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  We have not figured out exactly when he shall be  there yet.   \t      \t     Q\t  Is it open to coverage? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed. \t      \t     Q\t  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  we are still looking at that.  We have not  made a final decision about how we will -- who will make a statement or  what -- \t      \t     Q\t  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I would not rule it  out. \t      \t     Q\t  What about an AIDS czar? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is coming. \t      \t     Q\t  Anything on the weekend? \t      \t     Q\t  there is been a suggestion that he has going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march. \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he has been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat. \t      \t     Q\t  The weekend? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  do not know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday. \t      \t     Q\t  Any travel plans? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now. \t      \t     Q\t  he has not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now. \t      \t     Q\t  What about mid-week?  Anything likely? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  it is possible.  Yes, I think it is likely  that we will travel next week -- certainly the weekend. \t      \t     Q\t  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  I do not know.  i shall check. \t      \t     Q\t  Going to name a drug czar this weekend? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I do not believe so. \t      \t     Q\t  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package? \t      \t     MS. MYERS:  i am sure it will. \t      \t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END10:10 A.M. EDT
