A myth is more than a single story.  The thought  structure and world-paradigm in which that story is interpreted is as important a part of the myth as the story itself.  Thus, I can think of no story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person to another within a single culture which will not rest upon that underlying thought structure, and thus transmit some of that culture is mythical  truths  along with it.    randy
