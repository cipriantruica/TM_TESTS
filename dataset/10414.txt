From: brifre1@ac.dal.ca Subject: Leafs win! (thank you Potvin)  it is about time the boys got it together!! They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games. But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear (or is that high gear?) in game 3.  Except for a 10-15 minute stretch in the 2nd period, they outskated and outworked the Wings.  Please do not flame this statement \'cos you know it is true!  I have to admit that  goaltending was the key.  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd.  He also kept the rebounds to a minimum, something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals.  Clark even looked like he had stopped moping (first star!), although I still do not know why he was so flat in games 1 and 2.  If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 3, they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance,  but a chance....i am no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).
