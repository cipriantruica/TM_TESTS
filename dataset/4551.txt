I did not realize that you were talking about an Apple division other than AppleUS. AppleUS, being the main division, is the one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and configurations for the majority of Apple customers, and it is generally assumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple. At least that is how it has always been in this newsgroup. All other Apple divisions are, apparantly, free to change names and configurations if they feel like it. I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff all the time. it is not a mistake, it is Apple Sweden giving a different name to an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it.  -Hades
