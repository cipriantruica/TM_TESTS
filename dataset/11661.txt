Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB. So. look at it this way-- hadB\' has an implied reference while notation such as  hadBm\' has an explicit reference.  For power:    dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )  For amplitude    dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )  \'B\' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A  hadeci\' Bel is 1/10 of a bel. It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder is name. The small  had\'/large \'B\' is per SI notation convention. I do not know anyone that is been crucified for messing it up.  Common references for audio are:  \t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms \t0 dBV = 1 volt  \t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level) \t0 VU = -10dBV\t(consumer gear line level)   Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment.  Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm is law.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.
