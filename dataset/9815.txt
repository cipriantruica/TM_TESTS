From: grogers@slacvx.slac.stanford.edu (Greg Rogers) Subject: Hockey on TV in the Bay area, NOT!  Hi all,  I do not get the sport is channel and i am desparate for some playoff action (especially the Cannucks).  Does anyone know of a sports bar on the Bay Peninsula that will be showing hockey games.  i am looking for something  between redwood City and Mountain View.  Thanks a lot, Greg
