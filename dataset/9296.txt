Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed replacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then of course the Blue Jays would not have won without Morris.  If the alternative was replacement level, then I think it would have been very close, and yes, Morris might have made the difference.  If the alternative was Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with Viola.  >Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the  >other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, >Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I cannot remember exactly).  Yes.  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented  the team from collapsing in August.  >Also, let us not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save  >the bullpen every fifth day.

What happened most of the time is that Morris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly, this is because he has a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better the rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes consistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris\' credit; it is to the team is credit.  Furthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support, he has not done this in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed. Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.  Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical Morris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  he has not responsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team just did not rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just did not earn him a victory.  >BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a  >veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more >can he be embarrassed?  Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he cannot start anymore; he has too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.  Greg
