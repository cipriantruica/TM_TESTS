Well, there does have to be a line.  And to be honest, extending voter registration to DMVs is hardly analogous to having only one place for registration in Alaska and opening a new one in Atlanta.

Anybody got \'em???         I thought the Motor Voter bill passed.         In any case, my experiance with Tennessee is voter registration system (which you can register with by mail, by the way) is that nobody who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration. All it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant is part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to it.  (Once you register it is good unless you miss for years worth of elections of move.)         it is easy to register now.  I simply do not see the value in going out and trying to get people registered who do not have enough gumption to even write and have the proper forms sent to them.   How can we expect responsible decisions out of these people?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.
