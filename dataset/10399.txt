From: nlu@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Nelson Lu) Subject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 3: Defensemen (21-45)   \tPETER AHOLA\t\tSeason: 2nd Acquired:\t\'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations Grade:\t\tI (B)  It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it is actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he has not been spectacular, and his offense is not anything to write home about (8 points); it is even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.   \tDOUG WILSON\t\tSeason: 16th Acquired:\t\'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and \t\t2nd round pick in \'92 entry draft Grade:\t\tI (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilson is last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.   \tDEAN KOLSTAD\t\tSeason:\t2nd Acquired:\t\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:\t\tI (C-/D+)  it is probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he has quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.   \tPAT MACLEOD\t\tSeason: 2nd Acquired:\t\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:\t\tI (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he would not clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a  rehab assignment  that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I cannot even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.   \tTOM PEDERSON\t\tSeason: 1st Acquired:\t\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:\t\tI (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5\' 9 , 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.   \tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\t\tSeason: 1st Acquired:\t\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:\t\tI (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin is entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.  =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!
