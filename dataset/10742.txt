Nixon extensively used the NSA to watch people because he did not like them.  According to _Decrypting the Puzzle Palace_:  \tPresumably, the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance \tby both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978(FISA) and a \tseries of presidential directives, beginning with one issued by \tPresident Ford following Richard Nixon is bold misuse of the NSA, in \twhich he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic \tsurveillance of political dissidents and drug users.  \tOf course, just because there are laws saying the gov\'t is not  supposed to conduct illegal surveillance does not mean those laws cannot be broken when they are in the way. \t\t\t\t\t\tDoug Holland
