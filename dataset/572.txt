That is, the belief in a diety is not necessarily coupled with agreement/love of that diety, so really they have yet another bit of convincing to do just beyond belief. I guess the standard argumet goes something like: well, once you believe in God, you know God is love, and you will choose to love him-- if it wasnt so widely accepted and asserted it had be laughable...  best regards,  --Adam  ================================================================================ | Adam John Cooper\t|\t Verily, often have I laughed at the weaklings | | (612) 696-7521\t|\t   who thought themselves good simply because  | | acooper@macalstr.edu\t|\t\t\tthey had no claws. \t       | ================================================================================ |  Understand one another?
