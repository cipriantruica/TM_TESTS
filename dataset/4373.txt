As I wanted to try to switch to 32 bit adressing, i could not startup my Mac anymore.  1.\tWhat is the trick to zap the PRAM (so I will not have to take out the battery next time)  2.\tIs there any trick that could allow me to switch to 32bit?  3.\tWhat does 32bit adressing bring to me as an user? faster work?  4.\tAny chance to have more than 8Mb of adressable memory with 24bit adressing?  Thank you a lot for your answers (via mail or reply)  Ralph Schwegler, University of St.Gallen, Switzerland
