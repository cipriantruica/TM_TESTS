It has been done, but the other companies do not have the marketing budgets that MS do.  4DOS, for instance, is everything that COMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS).  Those who use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine.  But they have to rely on word of mouth for sales.  It seems to have worked pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine.  that is okay, marketing is not a fundamental human right, but they have got a product that is superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way.  They have a lot more to be proud of than MS does.  If MS really gave a damn, they could duplicate it, buy it outright (they have got the money), or even use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with compatability issues and absconding with the technology.  DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch marketing and vendor agreements.  The  mediocre  was excusable in the early days when it was someone else is hack, but they have had ten years to play with it.  An interesting thought on that: Most MS products that i am aware of in the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and programmers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least have the names buried in the files.  Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0 and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it? --  there is at least one fool in every married couple.
