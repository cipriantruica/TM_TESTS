The    telco is not supposed to give that without a warrant.  that is the rule today.     But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the    judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext    without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops cannot record today is plain    cellular calls and then ask a judge,  Hey, can we have permission to    listen to those tapes?  can they?  How long do you think it will be before it becomes legal for the police to record encrypted conversations  it is not violating your privacy because we cannot read the encryption without a warrant , with the usual good-faith exception if they accidentally record a non-encrypted conversation.  Besides, it is covered by the Drug Exception to the Fourth Amendment... --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
