Any comments? :     I have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax anybody else. This seems to be ok for atheists. You do not get an atheist knocking on your door, stopping you in the airport, or handing out literature at a social event. Theists seem to think that thier form of happy should work for others and try to make it so.     My sister is a  born again, and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family for several years. She finally got the clue that she could not help. During that period she bought me  I was atheist, now i am Xtian  books for my birthday and Xmas several times. Our birthday cards would contain verses. It was a problem. I told my mom that I was going to send my sister an atheist piece of reading material. I got a  do not you dare . My mom was not religious. Why did she insist that I not send it ??     Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to preach, non-religion should be self contained. What a crock of shit. I finally told my sister that I did not find her way of life attractive. I have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then.     i am sick of religious types being pampered, looked out for, and WORST OF ALL . . . . respected more than atheists. There must be an end in sight.  Dave Fuller dfuller@portal.hq.videocart.com
