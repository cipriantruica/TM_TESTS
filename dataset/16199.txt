As Texas does not appear to have an murder rate that much higher than the national average, I would expect it is a result of a much higher suicide rate.  >*I* should not suffer because of others....         Be nice if you did not have to suffer at all.  >We all agree on this one, BUT we also live in a sociaty and therefor >we will have to give up *SOME* of our \'freedom\' (Note the \'\').         Here is where we run into a problem.  I am perfectly willing to have government regulation on something which is likely to cause others harm.  What we are discussing, though, is the extreme regulation of a large group in order to target a small group, and I do not think that is appropriate.   >Do you have an insurance?? >Then you shall have to pay because of what others do...        > >Do you buy anything?? >YOU are paying for those who return goods, steal or even those who gets a bonus... > >Do you live with other people?? >Then you \'cannot\' do ererything you had want (burping/farting playing music LOUD)          Does this, then, justify anything?  At some point you have to draw a line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have something a little more substantial than a set of percentages with which to punish an individual.          Where do *you* draw the line?  Or is there one?  >One state (do not remember which, Texas??) tried to impose a rule that you could >only buy ONE gun each MONTH.

Does it?  >It seems like you all realize that you have a problem in America, the only >problem is that you will not take the car away from the drunk driver, you  >hope to cure him first.          Cute analogy.           The U.S. does not treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However, we also do not confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also do not confiscate *all* cars because some people drink and drive.  it is the core of the legal system that in order to punish an individual (and i had call property confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual. That is, it is not enough to show that the majority of people convicted of murder are white  in order to convict a particular white guy of murder.  >Hope life comfirms to the standard of Winnie the Poh.
