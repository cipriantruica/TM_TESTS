I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow    the algorithm through to hardware.  While I doubt the NSA would pull    any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the    chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it is an obvious    opportunity to introduce additional holes.  The chip is not the place to pull the monkey business - you do it in the key generation, either by having a mathematical backdoor, or by having the program on the laptop that supposedly generates the keys also save a copy of S1 and S2 and leak it out somehow, or by having the program that supposedly puts the official keys on the chip actually put a *different* key there (VERY hard to detect, since the escrow agents have to either trust the NSA laptop or give each other the S* keys, and they still do not know the algorithm.) Or have the chip-burner at the factory make copies of the keys. Or whatever. --  \t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill   Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ  \t              No, i am *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....
