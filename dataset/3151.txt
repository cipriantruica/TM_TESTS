Subject: help with internet!!! From: dfmorgan@acs.harding.edu  I know this is not the EXACT right place to put this, but im desperate!  i shall be going home for the summer, and wont have direct access to my VAX account....My problem is, i need a service that does not charge body parts, vital organs, or my first born son, that allows me access to the internet!  All i really need is to be able to TELNET to my school account, and from there I can do anything I need to do.   ANY HELP WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!!!!!!!!!  Please!
