From: dmn@kepler.unh.edu (there is a seeker born every minute.) Subject: blinking LEDs?       Where can I buy blinking LEDs besides radio shack?      * Does anyone sell blinking LEDs with variable flash rate? (by voltage     I guess) If so, what hertz (pulse) rate are they adjustable or set to?       i had like blinking LEDs that can be set for approx 5 hz, 10 hz,       15 hz, or 20 hz. Something like that... i am interested in what is      out there for flash rates. I like the idea of LEDs with flasher       circuits already in them. I hate soldering ICs in general. Guess I      do not have a hell of a lot of patience.          Thanks,           Dana
