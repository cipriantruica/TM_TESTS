The best group to keep you informed is the Crohn is and Colitis Foundation of America.  I do not know if the UK has a similar organization.  The address of the CCFA is   CCFA 444 Park Avenue South 11th Floor New York, NY  10016-7374 USA  They have a lot of information available and have a number of newsletters.   Good Luck.  Steve
