Hmmm....I was listening to the local radio expert (who is, amazingly enough, an Honest-to-God Expert(tm); it is amazing what he knows...),  and he said that, based on his conversations with the inventor of  Slick50 (who is no longer with the comapny, due to some kind of  conflict), he avoids it like the plague.  He does recommend other  teflon-based/type oil additives, though.  \t\t\t\tJames  James P.
