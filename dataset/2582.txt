From: jason@sigma.demon.co.uk (Jason Manger) Subject: Hhy will not my DOS apps run in a window?!  Can somebody help me out there? I have just purchased Win 3.1 and I just cannot get DOS apps (text mode apps) to run in a window on their own. i have tried mucking around with the PIF settings etc, but to no avail. What am I doing wrong? (I did not get this problem under v3.0).  Thanks in advance ...  Jason.
