I agree, it is very boring if you are not a Blues fan, but the Blues >played two perfect road games.   Not boring is right!!! It is more likely to cause me to have a stroke!! I had to listen to game two on the Blackhawk station and I do not think I could take another call of  And JOSEPH makes a SPEcTACular saaaaaave . Now i am a Blues fan, but I do not want them to play  like  they played in game two. Sure the result was fine, but the Blues match up very well with the Hawks so they really do not need to treat them like the 86 Flames. We do not need a  Monday Night Miracle  to have a chance to beat Chicago. The Blues can do it on talent. At least over the hawks.
