I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick.. detested it in the auto(like i did any other time in the auto...).  Of course, Dalls rush hours are nothing, from what i hear..if i lived in LA, i might be of a different persuasion.  And, just for the record, rarely do you shift gears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th is good up through around 80-90, most of the time, so you can just wind it out.. it is not going to hurt anything, and keeps it in the powerband anyway.. only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th(fairly rare, unless you drive a ferrari or some such, i had bet) or when you hit cruising  speed where you feel comfortable(or when my mother is sitting in the  passanger seat complaining about how you wind her  poor little engine  way too hi :-) Just my HO is..
