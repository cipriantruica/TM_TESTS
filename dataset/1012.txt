From: tdawson@engin.umich.edu (Chris Herringshaw) Subject: WingCommanderII Graphics     I was wondering if anyone knows where I can get more information about the graphics in the WingCommander series, and the RealSpace system they use. I think it is really awesome, and would not mind being able to use similar features in programs.  Thanks in advance.   Daemon
