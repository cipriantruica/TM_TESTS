Take care...Paul  There has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement.  True, there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but the internal power supply is well-protected. (i have turned my Mac on and off  six or seven times a day for three years without problem).  The monitor is the same.  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity -- twice as much as a television, possibly more.  Turn it off when you are not using it.  it shall save you money and the world a few more resources.  -Kelley- --  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Thomas Kelley Boylan, PowerPC, IBM Austin, kelleyb@austin.ibm.com -----------------------------------------------------------------                   I buy and pay for my own opinions
