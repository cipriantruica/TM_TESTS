From: kolstad@cae.wisc.edu (Joel Kolstad) Subject: Radio Shack voice recognition chips  Hi there,  I have a friend who had like to get a hold of a bunch of those simple voice recognition chips that Radio Shack used to sell (and no longer does).  If anybody knows of a source for these, please e-mail me.  i shall forward the responses to him.  Thanks!  \t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad
