From: lusky@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Jonathan R. Lusky) Subject: Kawasaki ZX-6 engine needed  i am looking for a 1990-91 Kawasaki ZX-6 engine.  Just the engine, no intake, exhaust, ignition, etc.  Preferably in the central texas area, but we have not had much luck around here so we will take whatever we can get.  Please reply via mail or call (512) 471-5399 if you have one (or more...  really need a spare).  Thanx  --  --==--         Turbos are nice, but i had rather be blown!  /           89 Jeep Wrangler - 258/for sale!       /                 79 Rx-7 - 12A/Holley 4bbl        /          ________67 Camaro RS - 350/4spd________/
