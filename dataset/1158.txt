From: dingebre@imp.sim.es.com (David Ingebretsen) Subject: Re: images of earth  I downloaded an image of the earth re-constructed from elevation data taken at 1/2 degree increments. The author (not me) wrote some c-code (included) that read in the data file and generated b&w and pseudo color images. They work very well and are not incumbered by copyright. They are at an aminet site near you called earth.lha in the amiga/pix/misc area...  I refer you to the included docs for the details on how the author (sorry, I forget his name) created these images. The raw data is not included.  --  \tDavid  \tDavid M.
