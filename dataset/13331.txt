Subject: Vasectomy: Health Effects on Women? From: eskagerb@nermal.santarosa.edu (Eric Skagerberg)  Does anyone know of any studies done on the long-term health effects of a man is vasectomy on his female partner?  i have seen plenty of study results about vasectomy is effects on men is health, but what about women?   For example, might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for, say, cervical cancer?  Adverse effects from sperm antibodies?  Changes in the vagina is pH?  Yeast or bacterial infections?  Outside of study results, how about informed speculation?  Thanks in advance for your help! -- Eric Skagerberg         Santa Rosa, California        Telephone (707) 573-1460
