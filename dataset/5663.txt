From: rick@ee.uwm.edu (Rick Miller - Linux Device Registrar) Subject: Where can I find a list of  - ?  i have just started messing with X Windows under Linux, and i have run into this  -  thing in the man-pages of a number of X clients.  Where can I get a list of these options?  Is this only an  xview  thing? (If so, would some kind soul show me how to set it up under Linux?)
