(And i am not entirely joking about those two names)  In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this system.  Indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody with an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed as an  oh goody  step upwards.  And look at how tolerant the public is.  they are willing to let the neighbours with the radios hear right now.  It was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping is going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it is just an ECPA violation.  This would stop that.  All tapping would need a warrant, or a breach of security at the escrow houses. --  Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366
