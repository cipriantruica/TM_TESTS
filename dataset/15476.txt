Rex, there are literally hundreds of thousands of 32nd degree Masons in this country, and thousands of 33rds. If nasty stuff was really going on, do not you think you had have more than a couple of disgruntled members  exposing  it? Heck, if what you say is true, then Rev. Norman Vincent Peale is an Osiris worshiper.   [... Long quote from someone named Hislop (source not given) deleted. i am attempting to extract from it the relevent points:     * Osiris is actually Nimrod, a Babylonian Deity.     *  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally     founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or     wife of Osiris.     * The Babylonian Nimrod and Osiris are both connected with the building     trade, ie, with Masonry.    * Nimrod, as the son of Cush, was a negro. [is not this refering to a      Biblical Nimrod, rather than the Babylonian god?]    *  ...there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by Plutarch, that \'Osiris      was black\'. ...]       There is a long tradition in Masonry of claiming ancient lineage for the order, on the flimsiest of grounds. This dates right back to the Constitutions of 1738, which cite Adam as the first Mason. i have seen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians, and Atlanteans. I even have a book which claims to prove that Stonehenge was originally a Masonic temple.       Claims prove nothing. where has the beef, Rex?  [...Claims ex-Mason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge] > Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard.     i had have to check this. The tomb paintings I remember do not show this.  >  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or should I say > hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the  spotted cow .     Can you give ancient citations for this? The druids were suppressed over 2000 years ago. what is your point?     This whole  leopard skin  business sounds bizarre.  I have not yet gone through the Scottish Rite (which contains all of those  higher degrees  anti-Masons get so excited about, and which was invented in the 1750 is), but I know enough people who have (and who are good Christians), that I reject your claim.  >i shall stand by my statements.

Sorry Peter, >I do not mean to be a  cold slap to the face  but there is to much  Not so much a  islap in the face\' as \'a weary feeling of deja vu\'. i am going through a very similar argument over on soc.culture.african.american.  >evidence to the contrary that Masonry does not find its origins in >Egypt.

Why do not you try reading some serious books on Masonic history, such as Hamill is  The Craft ?  >Why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago, >was freely admitted?     Because we got honest. If you can come up with actual evidence that Masonry existed prior to 1390, i had be VERY impressed (actually, anything earlier than 1630 would be pretty good.)  >-Rex \t\t\t\t\t\tPeter Trei \t\t\t\t\t\tptrei@mitre.org  Disclaimer: I do not speak for my employer.
