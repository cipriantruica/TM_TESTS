Probably because everyone (that is, everyone who has cable) can watch every Braves game. They are the only team that has all of its games broadcast nationwide. And if you do not like your local team, or you do not have a local team, the Braves can kind of become your local team because you can watch them every day.   --i am outta here like Vladimir! -Alan  =========================================================================== |  what is this?
