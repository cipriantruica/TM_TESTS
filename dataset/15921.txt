Would you, say, prohibit female college students from riding their bicycles near the university during the daytime?    Sounds a bit drastic, does not it?  Especially when the university is locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and nearly raped in just this situation.  The police did not feel she was in a situation which \'encouraged criminals\'.  What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she did not avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that is the case, then we would all better put bars on our doors and windows and pray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all situations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.    Larry Sacks Advanced Micro Devices lsacks@angelo.amd.com
