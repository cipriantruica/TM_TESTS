In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when  A exist  is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth,  A exists  is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.   A problem with such statements is that one cannot disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.
