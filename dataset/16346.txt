Wild speculation laced with a healthy dose > of paranoia?  Funny, Brent, but so far we have heard two versions of the  facts:   1) What the government says.  This includes what the government says that    two survivors have said.  2) What Koresh is lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says,    including what he says that most of the survivors have said.  Strange, but they seem to disagree in most important particulars.  If anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors speaking first-hand, feel free ot pitch in.  I may have missed it. But my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like case 2, and not at all like case 1. --   cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\' Packet...
