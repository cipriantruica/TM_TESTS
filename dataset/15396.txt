Though you can certaily assert all this, I do not see why it necessarily has to be the case. Why cannot hate just stay as it is, and not beget more? Who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner. I admit this happens, but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily so.  Why can we not hate with a perfect hatred?  >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our  >neighbors. He does not say anything about hate.

Amos 5:15 says to hate the evil and love the good. This cannot contradict Christ is teaching. I think we tie up both hate and love with an emotional attitude, when it really should be considered more objectively. Surely I do not fly into a rage at every sin I see, but why can I not  hate  it?  paul duggan
