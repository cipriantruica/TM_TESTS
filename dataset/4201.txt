From: auerbach@batman.bmd.trw.com Subject: Accelerating the MacPlus...;)  we are about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating our rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers. Yes indeed, difficult to comprehend why anyone would want to accelerate a MacPlus, but that is another story. Suffuce it to say, we can get accelerators easier than new machines. Hey, I do not make the rules...  Anyway, on to the purpose of this post: i am looking for info on MacPlus acelerators.  So far, i have found some lit on the Novy Accelerator and the MicrMac MultiSpeed Accelartor. Both look acceptable, but I would like to hear from anyone who has tried these.  Also, if someone would recommend another accelerator for the MacPlus, i had like to hear about it.  Thanks for any time and effort you expend on this!  Karl
