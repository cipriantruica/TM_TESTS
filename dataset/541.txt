Now, how is it such a grave mistake to sell Saudi Arabia weapons?  Or are you claiming that we should not sell any weapons to other countries?  Straightforward answer please.  >it is all very well to say  Oops, we made a boo-boo, better clean up the >mistake , but the US and UK *keep* making the *same* mistake.

Hint, it is not normally the gov\'t.  It is the contractor that builds that piece of equipment.  Believe it or not, the US and UK do not export the huge quantities of arms that you have just accused them of doing.  Arms exports are rare enough, that it requires an act of congress for non-small arms to most countries, if not all.  Do you believe in telling everyone who can do what, and who can sell their goods to whom?    > >mathew   --  *************************************************************************** * mccullou@whipple.cs.wisc.edu * Never program and drink beer at the same * * M^2                          *  time.
