From: sysrick@orion.spd.louisville.edu (Rick McTeague) Subject: Need help with MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE  i am trying to turn on Xauthorization using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE on my servers (CPU heads, HP700RX Xterminals), but i am running into a couple of problems.  First, at least one of our applications (Maple) does not seem to understand  how to deliver the magic cookie, and will not run on a display with authorization turned on.   Second, we have people with client software on remote machines, and I really do not want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support Xauthorization.  So, what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default, with non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based authorization.  (Yes, I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals, but non-privileged users cannot do this.)  i have checked with the HP Support Line, and there does not appear to be a way. Can anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what I want?  BTW, i am running HPUX 9.0, and Vue 3.0.
