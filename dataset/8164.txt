As we were crashing, she stayed upright in the  \tsaddle with her feet on the pegs and her hands about my waist.  I was \table to get the bike slowed down 10-15mph before we were high-sided. \tShe got off with a fair case of road rash and I had to have the doc  \tremove a lot of rocks from my knee.  Had she panicked we would have  \tprobably crashed at greater speed causing greater injury. \tBTW, as soon at the tire went flat, we went into VIOLENT tank- \tslappers.  This is what she rode out in a  normal  riding posture!   ----===== DoD   = Technician(Dr. Speed) .NOT.
