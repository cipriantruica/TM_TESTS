From: max@queernet.org (Max J. Rochlin) Subject: Re: Speeding ticket from CHP  Interesting.  i had fight the ticket.  First off, there is a 50/50 chance the cop will not show up.  Secondly, if he does show up, you should point out that he lied (purgered) on the ticket.  Why 70+?  I beleive that if yo\'re charged with going more than 15mph that the posted speed it is a more severe ticket.  You could not have p[ossibly been going 70+, right?!  --  |  max@queernet.org  |   Max J.
