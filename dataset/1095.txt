From: rws@cs.arizona.edu (Ronald W. Schmidt) Subject: outlining of spline surface   \tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.  \tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively \tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume \tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not \texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable \tmeasure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment \tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two \ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw \tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is \talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge \tcolored with a special  edge color   \tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.  -Thanks
