The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform real-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates sustainable by today is modems.  This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device, compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encrypts it with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio back to the audio device.  The compressed, encrypted audio stream is 13 kbits/s (!).  My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days, certainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity (audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I ran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember, though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can certainly be improved.  The audio compression routines can be ftp had from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de, I believe (look for gsm or toast).  I used Eric Young is DES implementation but I no longer know where I got it from.
