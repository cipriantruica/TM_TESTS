Righto, DAN, try this one with your Cornflakes...  The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was. Some reasons why he would not be a liar are as follows.  Who would  die for a lie?  would not people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe  he did make the sun stand still.   Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see  this right away. Therefore since he was not a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  real thing.    --  Ron House.                 USQ (house@helios.usq.edu.au)  Toowoomba, Australia.
