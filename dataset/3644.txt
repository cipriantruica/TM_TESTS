Some modes work fine, but others cause strange misdrawn objects, trails, etc.  Many have also voiced their strong discontent to Diamond is ambivalent attitude toward OS/2 drivers.  Come to think of it, though, I hear and see a lot of complaints about the ATI boards too, though recent word looks like the build 59 code looks much better.  Does ANYONE have an accelerated video board with drivers for Windows (OS/2?) where ALL the modes function properly?  Anyone?  Anyone?
