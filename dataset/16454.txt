From: lilak@peaks.enet.dec.com (Rod Lilak) Subject: Bennett : Banned, Bayonet     I wrote a letter the other day to Empower America - the organization which claims to be championing conservative issues, esp. in the wake  of the Republican defeat last fall.   Some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of  support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for \'96 run.  you had be close to the truth.  Their two leading spokesmen are Bill Bennett, former \'Drug Czar\' who heartily supported Bush is semi-auto import ban, and wondered if it went far enough -  who helped put the big lie about  isporting use\' into the public is eye - and Jack Kemp - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans.   These are conservatives ?   Anyway I thought it interesting that when I ran Word Perfect is spell check against my letter - it came up with the following corrections for \'Bennett\' :  1. Banned 2. Bayonet   Needless to say, I found these choices rather amusing.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  It [collectivism vs individualism] is an ancient conflict. Men have come close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage is whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from men.      -- Ayn Rand : \'Roark is speech from the _Fountainhead_\' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I do not speak for my company. We hire the \'Politically Correct\' to do that. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
