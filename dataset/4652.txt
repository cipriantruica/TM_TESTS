From: cris@cm.deakin.OZ.AU (Christopher Welsh) Subject: Need a 3 Button mouse. **Help**!   Can anyone recommend a 3 button mouse that is compatible with MacX and Quadra? If so, can the buttons be programed to say, cut, paste etc?  Can anyone suggest a supplier?  The only 3 button mice I know exist are:  \t1. Logitek\t$106.00 Aust (Injan ). \t2. Anorus\t$100.00 Aust (Mac direct). Are these ok for the above configuration?  Please reply me directly.  regards Christopher Welsh  -- Deakin University          \t\t\tChris Welsh Department of Computing and Maths\t\tcris@aragorn.cm.deakin.oz.au ---------------------------------- Everybody has enormous potential........ if only you could see what I can see.
