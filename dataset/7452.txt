I had a similar experience.  We had a written quote which had been mailed to us from the salesman at one of these  no-haggle  Toyota dealers for a Camry XLE w/ABS, leather, etc.  The price seemed fair, but when we went in to take them up on their offer, they  discovered  that certain extra cost items had not been included in their original written quote. It would have totaled an extra $1100 and, in spite of the fact that we had a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do.  Bottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that the Toyota dealers think they have got such a superior auto that they do not have to deal.  We walked, went out and bought a new LH car (Eagle Vision TSI) and I do not regret it one bit!  -- Thad McCulloch mcculloc@mail.lds.loral.com
