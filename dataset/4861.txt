From: d3e758@bucky.pnl.gov (JE Pelkey) Subject: Multi-screen apps and window managers    I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it is own monitor.   I have a number of X level questions regarding this:  (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be  predominantly Sun is, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).  I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens, and not multiple X displays.   Given this:  \t- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple \tas tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  there is \tnothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between \tscreens?  \t- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate \tscreens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? \tWhat are they; who sells them...  \t- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a \twindow frame and move a window from one screen to the next?  \t- Is there any way for the application to transparently see \tmultiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware \tonly provide for each screen to start at 0,0?  \t- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a \tsystem capable of using either multiple screens or a single \tscreen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate \tmultiple screens instead)?   \tI am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely \ton providing config files which will specify for each \tconfiguration the screen placement of each window in the \tapplication.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience \tare more than welcome.   ======================================================================== Jo Pelkey                                   Phone: (509)375-6947 Battelle Pacific Northwest Labs             Fax:   (509)375-3641 Mail Stop K7-22                             Email: je_pelkey@pnl.gov P.O.
