Yes, that is true, but you have to be clear exactly what is an uninterpreted observation. it is pretty low level stuff. \'The sun shines\' is already a LOT higher level than that. We can agree that \'I perceive brightness\' perhaps.  >#>Now I take an experience of good/evil to be every bit as raw a fact as an >#>experience of pain, or vision. >#That might seem like a good first pass guess, but it turns out to >#be a pretty cruddy way to look at things, because we all seem to >#have rather different opinions (experiences) about what is good >#and evil, while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says. >you are not comparing apples with apples.

What do you mean \'all in the same situation?\' let us take me and Dennis Kriz as examples. we are in pretty different situations, but I think we can agree as to whether it is day or night. I do not think we can agree as to whether or not abortion is morally acceptable. Yet we are certainly in the same difference of situations with respect to each other. Looks like weasel-words to me, Frank.   >#I do not see that it is any evidence at all. >#As I point out above, i am really not interested very much in >#what the popular opinion is. i am prepared to trust--to some extent-- >#the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation >#because by and large they accord with my own.

Huh? I do not think so. I think that people disagree about fundamental goals.  -Ekr  --  Eric Rescorla                                     ekr@eitech.com              Would you buy used code from this man?
