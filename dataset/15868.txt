Anyway, here is how I see the Waco affair; i had be interested in other peoples\' interpretations...  1. Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business. 2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I would not have    disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However, I think    the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style    assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other    noncombatants. 3. I do not see they could not just leave a token guard on the place and wait    the BDs out; I do not approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused    the fire to be started, I think the FBI agent responsible should spend    10-20 years in jail. 4. However, if Koresh is response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,    I hold him largely responsible for their deaths.     don
