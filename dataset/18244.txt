I noticed this dead horse in your Keywords line. Is this the famous scarlet horse of Babylon that the Beast (that is 666 for you illuminatti) rides on in those wonderful mediaeval manuscripts. If so, I fear your announcement that the old girl is dead may be premature. I bet $20 on her to place in the 6th race at The Downs last Sunday, and she slid in a bad fifth. So she is not dead. She is just comatose. (like god that way, I suppose).
