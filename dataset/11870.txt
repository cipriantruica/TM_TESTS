From: ddr@flux.isr.alaska.edu (Donald D Rice) Subject: Heavy-duty antenna simulation software   I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for antenna simulation, particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations (though good PC software would also be of interest). i am aware of the numerous mininec mutations, and have been using MN for some time now.  i am primarily interested in HF, VHF, and low UHF (< 500 MHz) designs, mostly wire antennas, but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well as for your basic thin wire assumption. Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself?  i have seen a version that was mutilated to run (sort of) under Microsoft Fortran, but i am not sure how many  new and improved  versions of the code might be out there somewhere. i had also be interested in non-NEC derivatives.  The ones i have seen have been aimed at microwave applications, but if there is something out there useful at the lower frequencies, i had like to know about it.
