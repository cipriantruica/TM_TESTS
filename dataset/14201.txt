Sorry, you have a _wish_ for an uncluttered night sky, but it is not a right. When you get down to it, you actually have no rights that the majority have not agreed to give you (and them in the process). it is a common misconception that being born somehow endows you with rights to this that and the other. Sadly this is not true.   Now if you want to talk about the responsibility that _should_ go with the power to clutter the night sky, then that is a different matter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Greg Nicholls ...         : Vidi nicho@vnet.ibm.com or     : Vici nicho@olympus.demon.co.uk : Veni
