The article states that research has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the disease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  In patients with AMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.  In ALD patients who have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out.  ---Dale Cook
