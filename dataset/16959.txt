Otherwise, back to your own league, son.   I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.  This Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yet because he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, you attack him.  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi is question in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The only ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact are the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having some INTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race! {assuming you are also semitic} \tNow I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism during the 1930 is and 1940 is.  The Hirgun, and other branch - off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their very lives. \tI mention this not because i am anti semitic [i am part Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the Israelites pisses me off so.  i am not as critical of the Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the Jews.  It  is a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for German and European anti semitism.  \t\t\t\tPissed off at Immature,                           Closeminded, Self righteous \t\t\t\tSemites
