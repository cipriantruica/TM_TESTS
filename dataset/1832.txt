You can download it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but I do not know what the file is called or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try scanning the index files).  To convert a .BMP file to a .RLE file, you just load the .BMP file and do a  Save as...   Select  Windows bitmap  and  Compressed  (or is it  RLE ?) Whatever it is, it is fairly intuitive...  Sorry I do not have all the details, but i am currently on an IBM3151 dumb terminal and cannot do much researching...Good luck!   --  Brad Smalling :: Jr.EE :: GA Tech :: Atlanta, GA :: gt2617c@prism.gatech.edu
