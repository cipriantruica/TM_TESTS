Funny thing, the InterNet: I have no idea what xv221 might be - except that it might be something to do with X-windows on PCs (? If you know, and have used it, and think that it is good, email me. [ryanph@mrl.dsto.gov.au]).  DV/X is a common abbreviation for QuarterDeck corporation is Desqview/X software.  I have not used DV/X yet, but reading the blurbs that Quarterdeck sent me, it sounds pretty great: \t* allows multiple DOS machines - the way that OS/2 does, but without requiring 10 MB of RAM to get OS/2 going \t* pre-emptive multi-tasking \t* network computing - a proper X-windows client/server application - this means that DOS program can be used on other X-windows computers on your network, and that X-windows programs can be used on your DV/X computer \t* although it is NOT a version of Unix, it effectively has many of Unix is features, and mostly you will be able to compile unix-type programs using the djgpp or gnu c compilers  They advertise regularly in all of the major computing and programming magazines. They also have InterNet support online (support@qdeck.com).  > *  Pascal PERRET     \t\t|\tperret@eicn.etna.ch         *  Hope that this helps anyone wanting to know.  Phil Ryan Melbourne, australia
