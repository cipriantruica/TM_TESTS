From: Kirk_Cowen@panam.wimsey.bc.ca (Kirk Cowen) Subject: references...  i have got the same problem; I cannot dig up any info on the jumper settings on the hd 3.5  drives.  Can anyone recommend a reference book(s) on the subject, rather than a  quick fix  type answer??  I was going to start hooking up things and logging the results, but the prospect of a ten second smoke test deters me...  Thanks, Kirk Cowen.  -- Via DLG Pro v0.995
