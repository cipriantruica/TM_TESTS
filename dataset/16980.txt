Not exactly the same, but reminiscent of the assassination of Count Bernadotte, who was _the_ UN negotiator during the 1948 Israeli war of independence.  He was killed by the Israelis.  Seems he was being too successful in negotiating a cease-fire, which would have worked territorially against the nascent Israel, compared to continued war. -- =Jim  eggertj@atc.ll.mit.edu (Jim Eggert)
