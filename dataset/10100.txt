Funny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out Vanbiesbrouck is mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect of:  You see?  He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask  and he cannot stop a beachball!   You may or may not take Cherry seriously at all, but I cracked up when I heard it.  I think Ed Belfour has the current best mask in the NHL btw.  I also like Moog is, and i shall give Fuhr is new one an honourable mention, although I have not seen it closely yet (it looked good from a distance!).  what is also neat is Chevaldae is in Detroit; they call him  Chevy  so he has two checkered flags painted at the top as in an auto race.
