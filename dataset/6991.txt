From: etxmst@sta.ericsson.se (Markus Strobl 98121) Subject: Renting from Alamo\t  Hello netters!  i am visiting the US (i am from Sweden) in August. I will probably rent a Chevy Beretta from Alamo. i have been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days.  This would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (Baltimore).  They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but I doubt that,  because a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than what is included in the base price. But on the other hand he did not rent it from Alamo.  Does anyone have some info on this?  Is $225 a rip-off?  Probability that i shall be needing more insurance? Is the beretta a good rental car?  Thanx  Markus
