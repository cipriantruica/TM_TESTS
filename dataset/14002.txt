I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record- players and radios in the 1960s was not better performance but lower per-unit cost than vacuum-tube systems.  \tMind you, my father was a vacuum-tube fan in the 60s (Switched to solid-state in the mid-seventies and then abruptly died; no doubt there is a lesson in that) and his account could have been biased.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tJames Nicoll
