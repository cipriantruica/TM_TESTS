I have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement but...... by far the worst  band  wagon  fans are the PIT fans (at least at the present). Case in Point -- I know a guy who just came to Hockey Hell(TM) from Pitt U. Him -  How \'bout the Pens? The\'re F-ing awesome  Me -  Yeah but beating up on the Devils does not mean alot. Wait until \tthey meet Boston and/or Detroit in the Playoffs start.  Him -  When do the Playoffs start?  Me -  Uhhhh. They started a week ago.   i am not saying that this is true of all the Waddlers fans but there seems to  be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except that they are newly beloved Waddlers are the best team in the game right now and when they are not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork.
