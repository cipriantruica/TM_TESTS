BUT...  Suppose they had waited.  The WORST outcome would have been the one that actually did.  But with the FBI/ATF just standing there watching instead of being a part of the problem.  It then would have been very clear exactly who was at fault then, rather than the way it turned out.    AND, that would have been the WORST case.  The best would have been, they finally get hungry and come out.  Possible/likely?  Well, the alternative was worse...  >>One other point, i am no fan of Janet Reno, but I do like the way she had the >> balls  to go ahead and take full responsibility.

Most of the time, the >higher-ups claim  I do not remember...  or  I had no involvement...   :-)    But what does it matter?  Why say  I do not remember....  when it does not make any difference?  Altho the clintonettes have been pretty good at lying when it was not necessary, they did not do it this time.  But it was not  necessary - claiming full responsibility is a totall meaningless gesture. Symbolism over substance - again!      i have offered to take full responsibility.  When do they pay me the big bucks the AG is making...????   ;^) --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bob Rahe, Delaware Tech&Comm College | AIDS, Drugs, Abortion: -        | |Internet: bob@hobbes.dtcc.edu        |  - do not liberals just kill you?| |CI$: 72406,525 Genie:BOB.RAHE        |Save whales; and kill babies?    | -------------------------------------------------------------------------
