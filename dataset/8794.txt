One word(Cone) should help things tremendously. I think > you are way off the mark here.  Another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too.

The Cubs are worse  The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and  expansion Senators finished tied for last.  The 1962 Colt 45 is finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last). The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last). The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).  Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A is or Chicago  team around is a `good thing\'  > >National League West >  > >\tCincinnati      ---- > >\tHouston          5.0 > >\tAtlanta          8.0 > ARGH! Here is where you are obviously dead wrong. Not since the Yankees of > the 20 is and 30 is has a team been so nicely setup as this years(and years  > to come) Braves. I do not think that the All-Star team will be able to beat   This may be an appropriate comparison. The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing  18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first.  In 1933,\'34 and \'35 they also finished second ( though they were only 7, 7 and 3 games out). Even great teams can lose - that is why they play the season. (on the other hand... i am still picking the Braves to go all the way)  john rickert rickert@nextwork.rose-hulman Predictions for \'93: Marlins: 70 wins, Rockies: 50 wins and....Rockies fans will claim that the offense is adequate.
