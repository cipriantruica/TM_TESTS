(let us pretend it IS INFLATED and PRESSURIZED) would not there be a large static electricity build up around the puncture? If the metalization is behind a clear sandwich (ie. insulated) then the  deflating balloon would generate electrical interference -  noise   By the way, any serious high velocity impact would simply cut a  Bugs Bunny  hole through the wall, highly unlikely to  BOOM , and the fabric would almost certainly be ripstop.
