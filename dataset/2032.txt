I do not think it is the awkward  recursive deletion that is bugging people, it certainly is not the nice Windows  interfaces for new DOS accessories (CPAV, defrager, undelete).  \tAs far as i have noticed, it is DoubleSpace crashes.  Frankly, the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes i have heard of surprises  me!  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace, it is  less likely to crash (unlike Stacker, which fools the OS... but DO is gullible  anyway :).  DOS 6 _is_ aware of DoubleSpace is not it?  Anyway, good job on DOS 5, and DOS 6 is good for new users.  Just beware the  doublespace!
