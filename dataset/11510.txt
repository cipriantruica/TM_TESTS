Those components are very widely  \tI concur for a PC to PC version.  BUT for a interactive thing like internet talk radio?!?!  It makes me cringe at the amount of hogging such a thing would do to the bandwidth of the internet.  I mean 15 meg files getting floated around for internet talk radio is bad enough.  I have a solution; use the phone system; take your electronics and use them on point to point  conversations through the phone and thats it.  If you need to tell someone  something secret and very important would not it make more sense to write it  out concisely? And if it is just a quick  YO  then use a code word and spend  your twenty cents. \tThose good ol analog systems like Shortwave, Telephones, and TV is have a use do not gunk up a nice digital packet network trying to emulate them!
