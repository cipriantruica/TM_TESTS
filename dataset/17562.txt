Note that the laws that do not agree with you were passed to protect a class of people who could not get justice from the state courts; specifically civil rights workers in Missisippi in the 60 is. The  federal protection of individual rights supersedes the non-feasance of the state. Something similar has long been traditional ( well he has queer so I beat him up...) for gays   > >You pays your money and you takes your pick... me, I lean strongly >towards the  against  argument.

Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define equality to regard the property in terms of it is significance for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed toward poorer people.  In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal  protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a  motivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed. i am sure that is a great relief to Douglas Meier.    --  Nick Nussbaum\t\tnickn@eskimo.com\tPO 4738 Seattle,WA 98104
