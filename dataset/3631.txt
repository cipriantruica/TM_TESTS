The original poster, John Navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on a SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at 76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously could not handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly.  When buying a third party monitor that is going to be used on a SparcStation LX, you might consider a monitor that is fast enough to do 1280*1024 at 76Hz. I do not know for sure whether the LX supports this (Sun certainly will not tell you) so you shall have to check.
