Do you know  >of a private Titan pad?   you had need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume no new launcher development.  If you assume new launcher development, with lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably do not want to build something HLV-sized anyway.  Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans.  It does not take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large gas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster, all of which would have far better cost-effectiveness.
