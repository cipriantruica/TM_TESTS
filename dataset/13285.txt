THE diarrhea problem?  WHAT diarrhea problem?  First, candidal overgrowth is not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy, and not all cases of antibiotic-related diarrhea have anything to do with candida.  But a case of vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy is not going to surprise anyone either.  that is not what people are disagreeing with.  >Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A  >supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the  >good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the  >pH to basically starve the candida out.  Oh, really?  where did you come up with this?  You know, it is really appalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters in a bizarre synthesis from reading reports in the literature. Bobbing for citations in the research literature is not medicine. I hope you are not giving the wrong idea to your medical students.  --  Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer
