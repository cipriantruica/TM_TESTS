Being  frightening  is not a crime.  Some people are afraid of young Black males.  That does not make the mere status of being a young Black male a crime.  The BATF itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades.  There is no evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement  personnel.  Under those circumstances, other persons have been found to be acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified armed intruders.  >     At this point I place little or no credibility on any of the charges  > of child abuse or molestation, but I would remind you that the Branch  > Davidians are not the only ones burying their dead. >  The charges are irrlevant anyway, since the BATF has absolutely no jurisdiction in such matters anyway.  Of course that has not stopped them from making other such spurious charges, such as the existence of mythical  meth labs .  Of course they whole  cult  thing indicates the level of contempt that they have for the 1st amendment.  > >sure they were crazy, no dought about it, but what did they do wrong?  >  >     They attempted to stage an armed resistance to federal authorities  > under conditions that placed dozens of unarmed and innocent people in the  > line of fire.  >  That armed resistance, at least initially, may well have been LEGAL.  --  ===================================================================  you are like a bunch of over-educated, New York jewish ACLU lawyers fighting to eliminate school prayer from the public schools in Arkansas  - Holly Silva
