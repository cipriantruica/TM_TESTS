Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware, and therefore your machine cannot keep up with things.  Ever notice how when acessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I  imagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time, and sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.  I cannot even run in  medium speed with CP backup on my machine, supposedly because I have a SCSI machine which places extra demands on the data bus.  don
