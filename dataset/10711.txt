I do not know any drug lords, but i am sure they would favor something tappable over something secure as long as the user interface is nice.  \tWhen you have got HRH Prince of Wales saying stupid things over cordless phones, it is not hard to imagine that drug dealers, child pornographers, commies, LISP programmers, and other threats to the civilized world might transact incriminating business over  encrypting  cellular phones.   mjr.
