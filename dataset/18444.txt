Do you have any habits that you cannot break?  If I have a habit that I really want to break, and I am willing to make whatever sacrifice I need to make to break it, then I do so. There have been bad habits of mine that i have decided to put forth the effort to break, and i have done so; there have been other bad habits that i have decided are not worth the effort to break.  it is my choice, either way.  I am my own master.  I choose what I want to do.  I weigh the benefits of my actions against their consequences, and I use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.  I do not always succeed, but I never fail, either -- I learn.  Do *you* have any habits you cannot break?  Why not?  >For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand >even the slightest concept of the Bible.  I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity, just as you have probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion. Are you  unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Quran ?  If that is different, then how is it different from what you accuse me of?  Can I accuse you of having no desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism?  >How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires >in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize >women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in >your head?  Of COURSE not.  that is disgusting.  For centuries, religions have been discriminating on sex and treating women as second-class humans; that is one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity.  >Do you insult >people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next >time opportunity presents itself?  No.  I do not insult people.  Period.  it is not in my nature, and it is not something that I want to do, either.  >Are you truly the master of yourself?  Not yet -- but my life is the ground I use to practice on.  The fun is in the getting there!  >I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. >That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake >unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect >of my being.  There are times I know I should not say something, but >then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson. >I, in fact, am not my own master.  We do not start out perfect; we have got to strive to be something better.  I know my shortcomings, and I know my strengths, and I live my life according to the decisions I make, and I am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as i shall accept the praise for them.  There have been times in my life when i have made mistakes, yes; I try to never make the same mistake twice.  >I need help.  Jesus promised me >this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let >Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than >I myself do.  I regard Christ as a myth.  I feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.  I choose the roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of any given road or turn back -- and as long as I do not *always* turn back, there is no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.  >>Do you see my point?  I think you are the one under the rock, and i am >>getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.

Because Brian, you enjoy >not having a clue about the Bible.     And you do not have a clue about what i am saying, either.  Open your eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  i am not just spouting off empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.  >>do not you see?  i am not going to accept ANYTHING that I cannot witness >>with my own eyes or experience with my own senses, especially not >>something as mega-powerful as what you are trying to get me to accept. >>Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good >>*reason* to, do not you? > >Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and >concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers >to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch, >then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid >of your emotions.  Huh?  you are going WAY off the track here.  I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to definite things she is done for me, and I can even just bring her to you so you can ask her, face-to-face.  You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask?  You cannot even convince me that it exists!  >My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have >life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal >torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to  >live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that >was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  it is >wishful thinking.  If any god dangles \'heaven\' before me like a carrot, promising untold pleasures to me if i shall only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once, then I would choose \'hell\'.  I can *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful it is.  Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way: Yahweh, Allah, Zeus, Odin, Ra...  Please give me a solid reason to choose one of them over the others.  [ description of Kendigism deleted -- hee hee! ]  >Why would you want to live a good life? >To you, you die and that is it.  do not contradict yourself.  You have >no reason to live a good life.  It does not do you any good in the >end.  Your life does not do anybody else any good  either because >everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading >a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?  That paragraph demonstrates that you have not listened to a single word i have said.  Have you ever gone to an amusement park?  Why?  I mean, after a few hours, it closes, and nothing is different except that you are a few dollars lighter.  Going to the amusement park does not do you any good at all.  Why do you do such a meaningless thing?  The answer is that you think it is fun.  You play the skee-ball over and over because you had like to get better at it, even though you are not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you blow ten dollars on it.  You ride the roller coaster because it is an thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out of you.  In the same way, I think life is fun.  And I do not intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D  >>i am sorry, I do not feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god >>i had worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in >>which case it is not really all that important. > >Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.  So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa Claus delivers toys every xmas.  do not you see?  I have NO REASON to believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I cannot similarly apply to Santa Claus.  >>Forget the Bible for a minute.  Forget quoting verses, forget about >>who said what about this or that.  *Show me.*  Picture just you and me >>and a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you are right. > >Forget that I am a person.  Forget that I know how to type.  Forget >that I know how to put a sentence together.  Forget that I know >how to send e-mail.   Forget my existence.  Proove to me that I >exist.  .  I cannot do it, because your existence means nothing more to me than just your communications over the net.  You have no more bearing on nor importance in my life than that; remove it, and you will cease to be significant to me.  Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without invoking them?  Or do you mean that the existence of your deity (and, in fact, any other deity that can be written about) is as real as your own existence?  Why do you believe what you believe?  --  _/_/_/  Brian Kendig                             Je ne suis fait comme aucun /_/_/  bskendig@netcom.com                de ceux que j\'ai vus; j\'ose croire _/_/                            n\'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent.   /  The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre.  /    is that it ends.                                           -- Rousseau
