Pin\tDescription  1\t+ input 2\t- input 3\tGS (gain select through use of feed back resistor) 4\tVref (reference voltage OUTPUT, about Vdd/2) 5\tconnect to Vss 6\tconnect to Vss 7\tosc1 clock input 8\tosc2 clock output (connect crystal across pins 7 and 8) 9\tVss 10\tOE output enable (logic high allows data output) 11\tQ1 data output 12\tQ2 data output 13\tQ3 data output 14\tQ4 data output 15\tStD Delayed Steering Output (any other company would call this  hadata valid\'.) 16\tESt Early Steering output, sort of like  i am starting to hear a tone . 17\tSt/GT Steering input/guard time output 18\tVdd  Power Supply\t: 4.75V min., 5.25V max. Current\t\t: 3.0mA Typ, 7.0mA max.  BUT.......  You really should have bought the Motorola part from me.  :-) (I still have them in stock)  John    If someone could fax, email, or snail mail a copy >of the spec sheet for this chip that would be even better. :) > >Please email me if you can help.   > >Thanks in advance, >--  >Mont Pierce > >+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ >| Ham Call: KM6WT             Internet:  mont@netcom.com                  | >|    bands: 80/40/20/15/10/2  IBM vnet:  mont@vnet.ibm.com                | >|    modes: cw,ssb,fm                                                     | >+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
