If you go 70mph on your dirtbike then feel free to contribute.  >>>jeeps >> >>you are *supposed* to keep the windscreen up > >then why does it go down?  Because it would not be a Jeep if it did not. A friend of mine just bought one and it has more warning stickers than those little 4-wheelers (I guess that is becuase it is a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it is written in about ten places that the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they have made it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the  highway as for bikers. They may participate in this discussion, but they are probably few and far between, so I maintain that this topic is of interest primarily to bikers.  >>>snow skis >> >>NO BUGS, and most poeple who go fast wear goggles > >So do most helmetless motorcyclists.  Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the  two parts of the statement. Besides, around here it is quite rare to see  bikers wear goggles on the street. it is either full face with shield, or  open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of  bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound  sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.  >>The question still stands. How do cruiser riders with no or negligible helmets >>stand being on the highway at 75 mph on buggy, summer evenings? > >helmetless != goggleless  Ok, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the point. i have been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean my shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered mess) and i had see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight t-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really specific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that  splattering bugs with one is face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it? Image? Laziness? To make a point about freedom of bug splattering?  i have        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD   kV      got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca                          ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada
