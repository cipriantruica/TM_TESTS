It would seem to me that on a 486, the FPU is not being used, most of the cache is not being accessed, the off chip buffers/drivers are idle, the multiplier is not multiplying, the barrel shifters are not shifting, microcode is not microcoding, etc.  This means transistors are not switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS), which means less heat.   From what I understand, the Pentium shuts down those sections of the CPU which are not being used in order to cut down on heat/power.   --  Dennis Lou             ||  But Yossarian, what if everyone thought that way?  dlou@ucsd.edu          ||  Then i had be crazy to think any other way!
