The following is from a critique of a  60 Minutes  presentation on MSG    which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS    DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]  \t Chances are good that if you watched \'60 Minutes\' last November \t3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In \tthe segment entitled \'No MSG,\' for instance, show host Ed Bradley \tmakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them \t(\'millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently \tsick\'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven \tpersonal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the \tsubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive  \tthose studies are.  \tConsider his making reference at the beginning of the program to \ta study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order \tto back up his comment that there is \'a lot of evidence\' that MSG, \ta flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as \tin many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT \tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on \thumans but on rabbits.  \tOne of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist \tPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that \ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get  \theadaches from it.  \'But,\' she explains, \'the show probably  \toveremphasized the extent of the problem.\'  \tA second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor \tat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley \tremarks,  isays that his 20 years of research with laboratory \tanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters\' because \tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney is \tresearch with lab animals does not  ishow\' anything about human \tyoungsters.  \tIn fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney is  \texperiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected \textremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing  \ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly, \tand when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance \tto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither \tof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG  \twith food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by \tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little \treaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human \tblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations \tfound in Dr. Olney is lab animals.....  \tThe World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of \tthat fact.  And so does the European Communities\' Scientific \tCommittee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies, \thave concluded that MSG is safe.  \tTheir determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never \tbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed \tto it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a \tburning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe \tof clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently \texonerated the much-maligned substance.  \tthat is quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of \tmonosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever \twe eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one \tof the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken \tdown into glutamate during digestion.  \tit is a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the \tmost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes \tup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in \tmilk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.  \tThat does not mean it is entirely unimaginable that a small number \tof people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore \tsensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international \tprofessional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus \treached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.    -Rich Young (These are not Kodak is opinions.)
