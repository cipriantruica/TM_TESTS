Well let us quibble- look at the above statement that you posted, I have marked it with \'^^^^^^\', IT STATES THAT 1% ARE EXCLUSIVELY HOMOSEXUAL- IT STATES 2% ARE OR HAVE ENGAGED IN HOMOSEXUAL SEX.  And please not the use of adjective here  HOMOSEXUAL SEX .  Now I stated that if we take 1% as homosexal this is a valid viewpoint.  I believe that you are either 1) you are not writing what you think you are writing, 2) you cannot read or remember what you wrote.
