Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever grossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!  For example:  \tSIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same \tthing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the \tannual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite, \twhich means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the \tproceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.  \tTOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.  \tBasic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI \tmembership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings, \tthese are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic \trate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.  \tSIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they have also split out the \tComputer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to \tbe included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG \talso has doubled its membership fee.  What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple, like SIGGRAPH, all the  plus  services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they do not look so big.  But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31% increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31% inflation rate on the publications I got last year.  Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am? ________________________________________________________________________________ Robert Reed\t\t\tHome Animation Ltd.\t\t503-656-8414 robert@slipknot.rain.com\t5686 First Court, West Linn, OR 97068  SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS  Motif:  You spend days writing a UIL description of your foot, the   trajectory, the bullet, and the intricate scrollwork on the ivory handles   of the gun.
