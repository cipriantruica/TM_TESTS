From: mccoy@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (Daniel McCoy) Subject: R4 Version of xrecplay  I have and use xrecplay for X11R5.  Does one exist for X11R4???  I have tried to contact one of the developers, Eric Swildens, at ess@hal.com but he is no longer there and has no forwarding email address.  Archie is no help either.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks,  --- Daniel J. McCoy           |=> SPACE   IS      OUR     FUTURE <=| mccoy@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov
