Take, for example, Mark McGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that is not a potential great example of what you are talking about then I do not know what is. Now let us look at what happens when McGwire does not walk:   75% of the time he made an out.   10% of the time he hit a single.   5% of the time he hit a double.   10% of the time he hit a homer. Now, you are pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers, 1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you can get him out 3 times out of 4? Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even though he has never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in 227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that is right, he has *never* hit a homer in 916 AB is through the end of 1992. Who had be afraid to throw a strike to him?
