Even if there was no independent proof that Luke is account was valid, I find it strange that you would take the negation of it as truth without any direct historical evidence (at least that you have mentioned) to back it up.  The assertion was made, unequivocally that no Christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in the Resurrection.  Luke is account suggests otherwise, and in the absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken, then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect.  >randy   --  John G.

It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses could not be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs. Thus it is not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered for believing in the Resurrection.  Rather the issue is whether those who witnessed it did.  I do agree that the posting you are responding to shows that there can be liberal as well as conservative dogmatism.  --clh]
