From: kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Keith Keller) Subject: Playoff pool update  Well, I have compiled some statistics on the entries of my pool.  There are unofficially 52 entrants.  Here are the stats on what teams were picked to win it all:  Pittsburgh:\t34 (1 sweep, 14 in 5, 15 in 6, 4 in 7) Boston:\t\t6  (1 in 5, 5 in 6) Detroit:\t4  (3 in 6, 1 in 7) Montreal:\t2  (1 in 5, 1 in 7) Toronto:\t2  (1 in 6, 1 in 7)    (no, this was not Roger) Calgary:\t1  (in 6) Quebec:\t\t1  (in 6) Vancouver:\t1  (in 7) Washington:\t1  (in 6)  Why the hell has not anybody picked Chicago???  NOBODY!  Quebec got a pick, Detroit got 4, but absolutely no Chicago!  How odd.  Here are the  losers :  Detroit:\t20 Chicago:\t16\t(so there they are!) Pittsburgh:\t6 Vancouver:\t4 Boston:\t\t2 Calgary:\t2 Los Angeles:\t1\twhat?!? Toronto:\t1  LOS ANGELES???????  Are you out of your mind?!?!?  Good luck to you, you shall need it!  So Pittsburgh is the consensus winner of the Stanley Cup.  they will statistically beat Detroit in 6 games.  HAHA  that is happening!  NOT!  As I said, every one of my picks will come true, and I picked Chicago to lose to Pittsburgh in the finals, so tough luck to all you who picket Detroit.   Well, tough luck to all of ya!  I am a genius!!!  ;-)  --     Keith Keller\t\t\t\tLET\'S GO RANGERS!!!!! \t\t\t\t\t\tLET\'S GO QUAKERS!!!!! \tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\t\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!  \t    A cow is not a vegetarian dish.   -- Keith Keller, 1993
