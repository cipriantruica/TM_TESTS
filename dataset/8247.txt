I have never experienced wind so severe it physically precluded operation of a motorcycle.  it is more a matter of deciding whether the aggravation is more trouble than it is worth.  This of course, depends entirely on your own particular circumstances and personal disposition.    --    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   Michael Robinson                          UUCP:   ucbvax!cogsci!robinson                                         INTERNET: robinson@cogsci.berkeley.edu
