Popping the top revealed:  \tOne  socket  for an additional VRAM SIMM  \tOne  socket  for a 72-pin RAM SIMM  \tOne socket for a flat-pack FPU  \tA processor-direct slot (PDS) identical to the LC/LC II, but with \tan additional set of connetions to one side (for the full 32-bit \tdata path that the LC/LC II lacked  that is it.  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit in the PDS, but that is the only place.  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Andre Molyneux   KA7WVV      Insert your favorite disclaimer here        | +-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ |      -=-------- PYRAMID TECHNOLOGY CORP |Internet:                       | |    ---===------ 3860 N.
