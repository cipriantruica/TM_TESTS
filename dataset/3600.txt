Connecting devices ------------------     Normally, a 7 wire connection is used. Connect:         GND1    to    GND2 \tRxD1    to    TxD2 \tTxD1    to    RxD2 \tDTR1    to    DSR2 \tDSR1    to    DTR2 \tRTS1    to    CTS2 \tCTS1    to    RTS2   If a modem is connected, add lines for the following:         RI, DCD   If software wants it, connect DCD1 to CTS1 and DCD2 to CTS2.   BEWARE! While PCs use pin 2 for RxD and pin 3 for TxD, modems normally have those pins reversed! This allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2 to pin 2 etc. If you connect two PCs, cross RxD and TxD.     If hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection can be used. Connect:         GND1    to    GND2 \tRxD1    to    TxD2 \tTxD1    to    RxD2 Additionally, connect (if software needs it):         RTS1    to    CTS1 & DCD1 \tRTS2    to    CTS2 & DCD2 \tDTR1    to    DSR1 \tDTR2    to    DSR2 You will not need long wires for these!   The null-modem connection is used to establish an XON/XOFF-transmission between two PCs (see software section for details).   Remember: the names DTR, DSR, CTS & RTS refer to the lines as seen from the PC. This means that for your data set DTR & RTS are incoming signals and DSR & CTS are outputs! .-.-.-.- end .-.-.-   Michael -- *  michael@jester.gun.de  *   Michael Gerhards   *   Preussenstrasse 59  *                           *  Germany 4040 Neuss  *  Voice: 49 2131 82238 *
