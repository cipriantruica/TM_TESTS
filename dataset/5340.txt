In fact, it tells \tme that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file.    \tSo far, the only way i have been able to accomplish this feat is \tto add the -T to the call to X in /usr/lpp/X11/defaults/xserverrc. \tI would rather not do it this way.  Does anyone have any other ideas?    ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Brian DeFord\t\t\t\tInternet: deford@netwrx1.nw1.com\t   Open Networks, Inc.\t\t\tUsenet:   uunet!netwrx1!deford   11490 Commerce Park Dr.  \t\tTel:      703-648-0013   Reston, VA 22091\t\t\tFAX:      703-648-0016  \t                         I want to prevent the
