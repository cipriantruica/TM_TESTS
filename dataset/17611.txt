You asked a question, and now you do not want people to answer?  I believe a legitimate question was asked.  Why should not cost and safety be used (at least in part) to determine legality?  i had like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea. Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that  drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as William F. Buckley supports it. > >My point was that it is pretty stupid to justify legalizing something just >because it will be safer and cheaper. >  >A few more ideas to hold to these criterion - prostitution; the killing of all >funny farm patients, AIDS  victims , elderly, unemployed, prisioners, etc. - >this would surely make my taxes decrease.  Your examples (except for prostitution) fail miserably to meet both criteria (safer AND cheaper).  Obviously, killing people is not  safe .  As for prostitution, why should not it be legal? -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...Dale Cook     Any town having more churches than bars has a serious                    social problem.  ---Edward Abbey The opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer is) --------------------------------------------------------------------------
