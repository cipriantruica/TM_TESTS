The one I like is Show Partner/FX. If you want it, I could give a copy to you. I did a lot of advertising with it - it lets you create both graphics (ANY resolution) and text frames, run it all as a  film , you can make choices and include music - I guess that is just what you need. If you are really interested, email me.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tVick. Victor Friedman\t\t\t\t\tvictorf@seas.ucla.edu
