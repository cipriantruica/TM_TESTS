Ah yes, that is exactly what I would do.  Hold Bible study. Take a nap. Always a wise course of action when you are being gassed.  >*\tThere was no group instruction of any kind from Koresh or his  >\taids after the tank invasion (referring to any kind of suicide >\tpact or counter-assault efforts.)  I do not believe there was a  suicide pact .  I believe that Koresh wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers. In fact, this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors\' stories.  >*\tEveryone had moved to the center of the compound in order to escape >\tthe falling debris from the tank invasion when the fire was set.   Yes, that is right.  And once the whole compound was demolished, where did they expect to go?  >*\tWomen and children who has sought shelter on the second floor from >\tthe tanks were trapped by doors jammed by the tanks ramming the  >\tbuilding and distorting the frames.

Hm, an interesting notion.  we will see.  >*\tKoresh was not seen the last hour before the fire and was assumed to >\tbe in his 4th floor room with some of his children.  More Bible study, no doubt.

Actually, on Friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and he could not flatly contradict the federal agents\' claims.  we will know more later.  In any event, it is irrelevant.  >*\tThe survivors unanimously stated that if the victims could have gotten >\tout they would have, that they were trapped by the tank-destroyed  >\tbuilding and the speed of the fire.  For six hours they were trapped?  The building was not  destroyed   immediately.  They COULD HAVE LEFT AT ANY TIME.  >*\tThe underground bunker cited by the FBI as the place Koresh could have >\tput the children had he not been a cold blooded killer had been blocked >\tby the tanks crashing down debris on top of the access door.  Six hours to move it away.

Irrelevant, anyway.  PR one way or the other, but no crime or innocence indicated.  >*\tDick saw bullet holes in Koresh is room made from the outside-in >\twhich indicates the BATF was indiscriminately shooting down through >\tthe roof.    No word on whether they were being fired back at, which is an operative question here.  >*  The fire was probably started by the tanks knocking over Coleman Lanterns  >\tthat were lit and sitting on a piano next to the wall the tanks busted  >\tthrough, though none of the survivors saw the fire start.  Right.  For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at  any point, and you leave a COLEMAN LANTERN BURNING.  Near BALES OF HAY.  >*\tEvery one of the survivors strongly denies ever saying anything to the  >\tFBI about starting the fire, hearing someone say the fire was lit >\tor any of the other stuff attributed to them by the FBI.  it is ultimately irrelevant who  lit  the fire.  They had ample opportunity to LEAVE.  >*\tHe said when he first met Koresh in the compound he expected to find  >\ta raving lunatic but instead found a rational, charming and intelligent  >\tyoung man and was very surprised by that fact.    Most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent, actually.  They tend to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators.  (Ex.: Ted Bundy.)  >*\tKoresh had no drugs stronger than aspirin to use against pain.  Medical assistance was jsut a phone call away.  Gee, all he had to do was COME OUT.  >*\tWomen with children had their own bedrooms for them and their kids >\tthat were appointed as nicely as Koresh is.

Anyway, outsiders RARELY see abuse.  it is a secretive thing.

I have NEVER judged them by their religion, but by their ACTIONS.  If they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would have been no raid, no siege, and no deaths.  Instead, they chose courses of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID, if not IRRATIONAL.  The first was to stockpile weapons.  The second was to shoot federal agents.  The third was to stay inside.  Just as we do not blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy weapon at him, I do not think the FBI deserves blame in this case.  --   | The Koresh cult standoff is over ... may his victims Recquiescat in Pace |  |                                                                          |  |                    (the above is a net.moment of silence)                |  Daniel A.
