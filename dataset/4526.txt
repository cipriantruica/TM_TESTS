Why do people copy the article, and the  only new thing they add to the post is there name?  i am not picking on  this person, i have seen a few of these.  Is it just a mistake?  Am I  missing something?  Is it some unknown net-equette I missed somewhere? I skip over all the quoted material, since i have already read it, and look  for the non-quoted material, and all I get is the name addition.  Is this  supposed to me  I agree , or  I second this  or what?  Sorry...  Just wondering if I missed something somewhere along the line...
