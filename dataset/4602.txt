The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the CD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless you get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.    You do not have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  it is just faster reading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD, but only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.  Paul
