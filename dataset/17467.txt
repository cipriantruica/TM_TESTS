IE. <I will explain slowly    their sexual orientation should be irrelevant, as irrelevant as their   gender, skin colour, religious affiliation, attitude to hand-gun ownership,   etc.  They want to FORCE you to hire the best person for the job, rent the   accomodation to the person who will look after it, do business with whoever   will make you money..  Yet, when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this  philosophy to cigarette smokers (so that people who smoked away from the work could not be discriminated against by employers), the liberal Gov. Wilder vetoed it.  Which shows that liberals do not give a damn about  best person for the job,  it is just a power play. --  Clayton E. Cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer  My opinions, all mine!
