It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever administration is current for things they could not possibly have initiated.  This chip had to take *years* to develop, yet already we are claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on us. Bullshit.  The *Bush* administration and the career Gestapo were responsible for this horror, and the careerists presented it to the new presidency as a fait accompli.  That does not excuse Clinton and Gore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it, but let us lay the body at the proper door to start with. --  \tGeoff Kuenning\tgeoff@maui.cs.ucla.edu\tgeoff@ITcorp.com
