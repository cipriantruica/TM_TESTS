The paper was distributed (against the wishes of the NSA - I have a copy with a few \'illicit distribution\' footnotes scribbled on it :-), and eventually published at one of the crypto conferences.  Things were looking good.  Then Xerox patented the algorithms.    I do not know of anything which uses them.  Also, Khafre was broken at a later conference and from work on a related algorithm I do not think the existing Khufu would hold up too well against a converted differential cryptanalysis attack, although it can probably be changed to resist this type of attack....
