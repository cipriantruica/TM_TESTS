Can anyone post how long they are \twaiting for an ordered car or how long they have been told \tthey will have to wait??   Ordered mine December 30, got it nine weeks later.  But the dealer said that *new* orders were being held up -- he did not expect to see any more 3.5L-engine LHs for awhile.    -=- Andrew Klossner  (andrew@frip.wv.tek.com)
