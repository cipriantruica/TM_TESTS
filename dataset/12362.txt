Any pointers would be appreciated.  \tThink video.  Brooktree sells a whole line of DACs that can \tbe used, normally for graphics applications, in either 50 or \t75 ohm systems.  For example, the BT468 can be had in speeds \tup to about 200 mHz, BT492 to 360 mHz, and 400 mHz with the \tBT109.    >--- Seema Varma  \t\t\t\t\tRick Spanbauer,  \t\t\t\t\tSUNY/Stony Brook
