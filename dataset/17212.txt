The  treaty on the exchange of the Turkish and Greek minorities (1923) left  no Greek minority in Turkiye, except a few thousand Greeks in istanbul.  Turkiye is no longer an obstacle for \'Pan-Hellenism.\' Although the material  basis of Greek policy is no longer visible, there is a residue, which  seems to unite the Pelopenisians, the Greeks who came from Asia Minor,  the Greeks who are originally from the islands of the Marmara Sea or those who live in the numerous Aegean islands. This residue is  also recognizable in the contemporary Greek government.  >As far a Greek Turkish wars are conserned I find it funny that a  >so informed Turk like you forgot to mention the Balkan wars 1912-1923.  Not a chance. Greece lost in each and every war conducted  solely   between Greece and Turkiye: in the Morea in 1821, in Thessaly in  1897-98, and in Anatolia in 1922. After the Ottoman Empire lost  World War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in  Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering  from a severe case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up, formed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and on August 30, 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army.  >> Turkiye  >> is no longer an obstacle for \'Pan-Hellenism.\' Besides, Greece lost  >> in each and every war conducted solely between Greece and Turkiye: in  >> the Morea in 1821, in Thessaly in 1897-98, and in Anatolia in 1922.  >> Especially the 1922 Greek defeat, referred to as \'the Tragedy of  >> Anatolia\' by the Greeks, had momentous effects on Greek mind and  >> behaviour.  >I find it curious that a historian like you forgot the wars that  >demolished the Ottoman Empire. 1912 - 1913.  I love people who do not read and then spout myths as evidence. Where were Greeks in 1912 and 1913? I guess, they were busy with...
