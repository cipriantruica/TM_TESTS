Some of them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations. Others simply do not address the issues.  You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spirit-led course in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know.  I suggest that you stop  proof-texting  about things you know nothing about. --  Michael L.
