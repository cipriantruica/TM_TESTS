The experience you describe is why I do not like to sit with my bike in gear - I figure there is a chance that i shall be startled in some way and stall my bike.  And I figure this is more likely than the chance that i shall be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time needed to put the bike in gear.  So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second evasive manuvers.  I split lanes so i am not at the end of the line. (Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  If I cannot split (perhaps there is not room) then I will stop near one side of the lane so I have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped.  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure it will!  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to stop, I have not had to find out yet.  Some cars have an annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to tell if they are planning to brake or not!  So in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch your mirrors until it is all clear. --  Paul Thompson    Apple Computer
