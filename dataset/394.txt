Well here is how I prepared.  I got one of those big beach umbrellas, some of those gel-pack ice things, a big Coleman cooler which i have loaded up with Miller Draft (so I like Miller Draft, so sue me), a new pair of New Balance sneakers, a Sony Watchman, and a couple of cartons of BonTon Cheddar Cheese Popcorn.  I have not decided what to wear yet.  What does one wear to an eternal damnation?  Dean Kaflowitz
