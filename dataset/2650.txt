It is true that TrueType fonts are larger than their ATM counterparts, but ATM fonts *do* get minimal compression. Running Stacker 3.0 report generator, I get:  \t File Type:      Compression Ratio: \t -------------   ------------------ \t *.TTF (TrueType)     1.4:1.0 \t *.PFB (ATM)          1.1:1.0 \t *.PFM (ATM Metric)  11.8:1.0  Although the metric files are small, they compress quite largely. And, as you can see, even the regular .PFB files have *some* compression.  So, doing the math on one such comparitive font file:  TTF Times = 83260 bytes/1.4 = 59471 bytes (compressed) PFB Times = 51549 bytes/1.1 = 46862 bytes (Compressed)  You still win out, even if the ATM Times font *is not* compressed.  Your mileage may vary depending on compression program.  --    When heroes go down, They go down fast || John M. Grohol, M.S.
