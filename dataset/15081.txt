The Lord IS working in our community (the homosexual community, that is).  he has not asking us to change our sexual nature, but He is calling us to practice the morality that He established from the beginning.  is not Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issue he can, especially homosexuality.  let us reach the homosexuals for Christ.  let us not try to change them, just need to bring them to Christ.  If He does not want them to be gay, He can change that.  If they are living a moral life, committed to someone of the same sex, and God is moving in their lives, who are we to tell them they have to change?  that is my two cent.  God Bless You All Loisc
