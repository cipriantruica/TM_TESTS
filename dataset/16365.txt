(Wasting money keeping Texans alive?  Hell no. let us spend it to import Haitians with AIDS so we can treat them at taxpayer expense.  %^P  )  >Anyway, he killed a few feds  So what?  The Feds killed 90+ civilians when they  ran out of patience , to use their own phrase.  If the Feds had not attacked them, they would all be home eating  dinner with their families tonight.  Too bad, but they started it.  Maybe next time they will think twice.  that is worth 4 stormtroopers.  >he has not the goddam hero here  Nobody says he is.  What he was was a victim of a left-wing government, that violated its pledge to protect and uphold the Constitution, run amok.   do not worry, though dweeb, we are gonna take it back.  (Hey, i am a white guy, but would it be OK if I quoted Malcolm X here, and said  by any means  necessary ?  Nah, never mind.  We can do this legally...  >he has dead an\' i am happy!!!!!  NO, you are just a brainless f*cking trogladyte.  Go beat up some soccer fans.  Ignorance is bliss, so drool on with that stupid smile on your  face when people die needlessly. I hope a badger climbs up your kilt.  (do not expect these UKies to care about this, folks...  these bastards never did like the idea that we Americans had the means to defend ourselves  and would not stand for tyranical governments, which is why we sent them packing  back to their dreary little island with their tails between their legs twice.)       ************************************************************************** *     I remember what I was doing         *    Bad boy, whatcha gonna do    *  *  when I heard that JFK had been shot.   *        Whatcha gonna do         * *  Will you remember the Battle of Waco?  *    when they come for you...    *  *************************************************************************** Ken Whitehead (kdw@odin.icd.ab.com)
