The original  seats are in exc. shape but they are uncomfortable as hell.  i am going to  store those and find a set to drive in.  I have all the Vette catalogs but  i am looking for a more generic type seat.  I can modify the brackets but   cushion height and overall width are a concern.  i have looked through some  local boneyards without success.  I would just like to find a pair of   cheapo is to use this summer.      Tom
