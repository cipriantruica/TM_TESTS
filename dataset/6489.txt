From: bm@shadow.columbia.edu (Blair MacIntyre) Subject: Sharp OS8000S for sale   I have an 8000S i had like to sell.  Now that i am finished with my TAing, I do not have nearly as many appoints to miss, and i had like to put the money toward a laptop.  Asking $200.  I bought it last Christmas.  it is in great shape and includes (as an added bonus!) a nice, padded leather carrying case. -- Blair MacIntyre --- bm@cs.columbia.edu --- CS Department, Columbia University  \t\t\t You drive, you kill.   --- from the movie  Roadkill
