Sure.  i have never been much of a racerboy, as anybody who has attended the Minibike Spectacular can attest.  ;^)  I get a great deal of satisfaction in riding fast, yet now so fast as to be overly concerned about not being able to maintain a clean line.  And while i am still known to slide the occasional tire, I much prefer to stay just to the sticky side of that line.  i have found that I do not heal as well as I used to in days of yore.
