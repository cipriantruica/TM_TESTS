Judging from the Wintach tests, I can hardly > imagine that there is a cheat driver for it.  I received my Graphite VL on Thursday, and i have had a little bit of  experience with it now.  In general, it feels *FAST*, although this is the first VLB card that I have tried.  Still, the results are  impressive.  With my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, i have had the following WinTach 1.0 results:   Card\t\t\t\tWP\tCAD\tSpread\tPaint\tOverall ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ATI Graphics Ultra\t\t13.5\t14.5\t19.1\t25.0\t18.0 ATI Ultra+ (no aperture)\t11.2\t13.8\t10.7\t20.9\t14.1 Hercules Graphite VL\t\t16.1\t67.8\t41.4\t52.8\t44.5  Unfortunately I do not have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB had an overall WinTach score of about 26.  The Ultra Pro was nearly as fast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests.  As an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/- redraw times.  There was no swapping, but i had expect there is a fairly heavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2 seconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson is contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex Micrografx Draw document.  So far, i am *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies. The installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI is.  And I did not have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...  With Hercules\' software developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for just $225 (or $200 for the ISA version).  Call 800-532-0600 if you want to give it a try -- i am a happy customer now!  --  [ /tom haapanen -- tomh@metrics.com -- software metrics inc -- waterloo, ont ] [        stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull ] [          up.  that is how the corrado makes you feel.   -- car, january \'93 ]
