Because i am a guy and most of my pillions are female.   Also, the other reasons, like having an idea where you passengers weight is, it being a more comfortable position for the passenger, and it being a more stable configuration all come into it as well.  Holding the grab rail is a great idea only for braking, when you do not want the pillion to slide forward into you, otherwise I do not find it works well.  -David (dagibbs@qnx.com)
