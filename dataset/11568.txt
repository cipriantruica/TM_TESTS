From: C445585@mizzou1.missouri.edu (John Kelsey) Subject: Clipper and backdoors  David Sternlight says:   >It discredits the writer with third parties to claim Clipper has a back >door. It does not.      Actually, David, I do not think it is any more intellectually honest to say there are no backdoors than to say there are backdoors, unless you have had a chance to examine the algorithm and the silicon closely.  For all we know, skipjack could be easily broken, or impossible to break.  And clearly, if skipjack is not secure, then the clipper chip is not worth much.      --John Kelsey
