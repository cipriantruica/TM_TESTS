Mind my asking why you are selling a used machine with a damaged keyboard for the about the same price as a brand new A4000/030 (A4000-EC030/4 megs/120meg IDE HD/HD Floppy/v3.0 OS - $1899)?  i had like to get an A3000 locally for something reasonable like less than 1K without monitor.  Brand new the A3000-25mhz/50 meg HD/HD floppy/2.1 ROM is not running for more than $1400 or so.  Considering it is damaged, probabably has a real old version of the OS i shall offer $700.  do not laugh...my A2000 is not worth more than $250-$300 these days.  N.
