Having a lot of experience with a \'92 Grand Am coupe, I can firmly state that they do have a lot of outstanding qualities.  Very reliable throughout.  Great layout of controls and components.  Very roomy considering the exterior size of the car.  They  look sharp inside and out.  The V6 that I drive has exceptional power and  drivability compared to other similar cars that I have driven.  All in all, it is a fun-to-drive, dependable, and reasonably priced vehicle. Please do not knock it with a statement like that unless you back it up with specific reasons why you feel that way.
