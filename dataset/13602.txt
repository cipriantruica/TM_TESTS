From: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech) Subject: Space FAQ 09/15 - Mission Schedules  Archive-name: space/schedule Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:23 $  SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE      SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM      Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,     and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version     of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)     periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly     included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or     the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming     missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.      Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The  Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,  ASC G&C 2102,     says:  \t During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is \tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower \tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) \torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a \tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other \tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort \tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of \tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining \tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target \tin second stage.       This really is a good answer, but it is couched in NASA jargon. i shall try     to interpret.      1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack \tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the \t relative wind ) and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line \tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly \tnegative angle ( a negative q-alpha ).\tThis causes a little bit of \t downward  force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z \tdirection) and this force  alleviates structural loading.  \tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they are about the \tmost  delicate  part of the vehicle.      3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more \tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or \tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be \tthe case if we did not roll ( performance gain ).      4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated \tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort \tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site ( decreased abort maneuver \tcomplexity ).      5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio \tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio \tantennae on the Orbiter ( improved S-band look angles ).      6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a \thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is \tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east \t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity \tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember: \tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. \tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its \tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question,  Why is not the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?   The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the  top      [Orbiter side] and the  bottom  [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V is.  (A side note: the     Saturn V is also had a roll program.  do not ask me why -- i am a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the  roll     maneuver  is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a  quaternion,  a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you cannot get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     it is worth asking if yours does not.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.       AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS      The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:  \tW6FXN  - Los Angeles \tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California \tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland. \tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas \tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California. \tW1AW Voice Bulletins  \tStation    VHF\t   10m\t   15m\t   20m\t  40m\t 80m \t------\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\t----- \tW6FXN\t 145.46 \tK6MF\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840 \tWA3NAN\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\t3.860 \tW5RRR\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\t3.850 \tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.340  14.270 \tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\t3.840 \tW1AW\t\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\t3.990      W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the     other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.      W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160. No mission audio but they     transmit voice bulletins at 0245 and 0545 UTC.      Frequencies in the 10-20m bands require USB and frequencies in the 40     and 80m bands LSB. Use FM for the VHF frequencies.
