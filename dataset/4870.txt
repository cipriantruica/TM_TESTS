Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean:  > \t-) multi-screen > \t-) multi-headed > \t-) multi-display > \t-) X-Server zaphod mode  As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.   multi-headed  tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even multiple screens even if they are multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg, a Sun with a cg4 display).   multi-screen  and  multi-display  would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of  multi-display  would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when it is used it probably refers to the same thing  multi-screen  would: a system that provides multiple Screens.   zaphod  is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen.  > Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle > (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ?  There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to X.  What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing about X.  \t\t\t\t\tder Mouse  \t\t\t\tmouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu
