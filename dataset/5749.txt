According to reports, if you do not have DOS yet, and do not have any  utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it.   For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 does not offer  much. you had never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able  to create, however. :-)  \tIMHO, it seems to be worth the $40 to upgrade.  DoubleSpace seems a bit  saner than Stacker 2.0 (which i have replaced).  MemMaker is nowhere near as  aggressive as QEMM, but it does not hose my system like QEMM did (at least it has not yet).  Microsoft AntiVirus is just the latest version (or a  reasonably recent one) of CPAV - mine was very aged, so this was quite welcome.   \tMS-DOS 6.0 am not the end all, be all of operating systems - but it is better than a sharp stick in the eye, unless you happen to be into that sort  of thing.  :-)  \t\t\t  Lee Preimesberger st1g9@jetson.uh.edu ----- Undergraduate Scum ----- University of Houston, USA                               ********           There is freedom of choice for every choice but mine.
