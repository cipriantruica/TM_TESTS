Velarde, Stankiewicz, and even Silvestri >\t  are better defensively than Owen.          Remember - it is still early. Look for his offense to tail off, and his defense to improve (hopefully). He has that rep because I heard that either last year, or over the last 5 years, or something like that - he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops - behind C.R. and Tony (i am not gonna help this sorry Mets team at all) Fernandez. I do agree though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far. > >\t2)Tartabull. The book on Tartabull was, keep him healthy and >\t  he shall produce.
