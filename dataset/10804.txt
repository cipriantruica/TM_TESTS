No. The LAPD officers were tried first by the State of California on charges of police brutality, and secondly by the Federal Government on depriving RK of his civil rights - a different crime.      The scenario I outline is more similar to the Oliver North trial. Ollie confessed to treason (aiding an enemy of the US) during Senate hearings, under immunity. The team which was later to prosecute him on criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON is immunized testimony. ON is lawyer brought up the probability that at least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the reasons this ON is still walking around free today.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeter Trei \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tptrei@mitre.org
