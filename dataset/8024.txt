Seems to me that the driver was driving the vehicle visually impaired. is not that like not scraping ice and snow off your windshield and such?  Say, that is another thing that bugs me.  Why do not people scrape their damn windows?  i have seen people driving cars with *barely* the driver is half of the windshield cleared.  Nothing else cleared.  This seems pretty stupid and is not there something (probably varies state to state) that says a certain percentage of the glass must be clear?  Oh, well.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brad Thone Systems Consultant Systems Service Enterprises St. Louis, MO c09615bt   wuvmd.wustl.edu c09615bt   wuvmd.bitnet
