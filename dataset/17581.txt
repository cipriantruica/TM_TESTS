OK, I admit I have no hard data on this. Why do not you help me with this? If you would compile a commented list of all grants, un-repaid loans (if any), and direct aid, i had be very interested to see it. If you could give me references from, for example, Congressional Budget Authorization Hearings, I could look them up here and i had be happy to post a verification of your data.  Otherwise, i shall try my hand at this, but unfortunately I will not have sufficient time available until the end of this month, so the results would be delayed.  Let me know if you are interested in doing this.  ___Samuel___ Mossad Special Agent ID314159 Media Spiking and Mind Control Division Los Angeles Offices --  _________Pratice Safe .Signature!
