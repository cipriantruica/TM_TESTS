Ron, you are an endless source of misinformation!  There ARE no sacral vertebrae.  There is a bone called the sacrum at the end of the spine. It is a single, solid bone except in a few patients who have a lumbarized S1 as a normal variant.  How do you adjust a solid bone, break it?  No, do not tell me, I do not want to know.
