THe digital side?  TTL? ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment  all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP is along with PLCC is, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP is to name a few.  I do not see a problem in packaging as long as you adhere to sound engineering practices.    A good source of information is Motorola is MECL System Design Handbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.  The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means you are most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself has far more inductance per pin than the package you are testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I do not see the big concern over the packaging because it probably is not going to make that much difference  If you are trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun... TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment. :-(  aaron  P.S. My opinions have nothing to do with my company...the standard disclaimer applies.
