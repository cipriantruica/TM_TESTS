Does the dismissal in the early church mean that the eucharist was a secret?  I mean, was it:  \tyou do not have to stay; from now on, only the membership can \tparticipate; you really do not have to hang around; yes, I know \tyou are obliged to keep up attendance to qualify, but now is an \texception, okay?  or was it:  \tyou may not stay; what happens next is secret  When we have had reason to conduct business meetings after church, we have made it clear that only members can vote.
