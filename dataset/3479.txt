From: idler@cs.tu-berlin.de (Andreas Kuehnel) Subject: Windows Virtual Memory   i have got a 386DX-40, 4MB and i am using Windows 3.1. Sometimes I wondered why  Windows worked endlessly on my HD when I was doing nothing (execpt having lunch or something like that). Then I turned this virtual memory swapfile off, and Windows became quite faster, but now having less memory free. And so i am still wondering, why windows is reading everything from virtual memory when the convertional is sufficient? Any common-sense-explanation is really appreciated.
