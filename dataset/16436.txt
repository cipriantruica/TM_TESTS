People who have both easy access and the desire to kill, kill people.  Considering that people who have the desire to kill turn that into easy access ....  (have not you folks learned anything from either Prohibition or the war on drugs?)  If you do not affect the desire, you are wasting your time, not to mention the other costs incurred.  >    Jim, i am just saying how it is.  i am not saying if that is a good thing >or not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun >buyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are >having an impact on the community.  Good for them.  I note that the TM folks make the same argument.  If you shall pay their expesnses ($21 million for a reasonable size city), they promise to meditate away all crime, disease, etc.  At least they are not promising to jail me if I do not go along with their little plan - they are going to just sit in a room and fly, leaving me alone.  >gun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you cannot measure >the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test >evaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  Ah, but we have evaluated gun control using before-after and it does not work to reduce crime.  What is the point?  We cannot claim that it is symbolic, as people do get jailed.  >The police are >essentially saying  look, if you have a gun lying around and you do not >want it, we will give you $50 for it...because we care about the community .  No, they are essentially saying  we hope this will keep you from noticing that we are not doing anything useful .  Pissing away resources is not  caring .  >If you, I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or >ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.  Nope, you shall merely be ignored, as Wright, Rossi, and Daly were after finishing  Under the Gun .  They were supposed to prove that gun control worked, so ....  >> Jim, listen to me, I said I\'M NOT RELIGIOUS WHATSOEVER, do you understand? > >  Religion has nothing to do with this.

Given their previous experience with thugs who threw grenades before yelling  we are from the govt and we are here to help you , would a rational person think that the feds had their best interests at heart?  Would you  know  that the gas was  non-lethal ?  -andy --
