The initiative will involve the creation of new products to    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.     For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our    private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the    tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of    protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate    the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and    law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against    industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.     Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to    protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to    protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption    technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the    unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used    by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.     A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the  Clipper Chip  has    been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a    new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,    relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to    an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications    using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in    commercial use today.     This new technology will help companies protect proprietary    information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations    and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted    electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the    ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to    intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.      A  key-escrow  system will be established to ensure that the     Clipper Chip  is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding    Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique   \t\t\t\t   2       keys,  numbers that will be needed by authorized government    agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the    device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately    in two  key-escrow  data bases that will be established by the    Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to    government officials with legal authorization to conduct a    wiretap.     The  Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with no    new authorities to access the content of the private    conversations of Americans.     To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the    Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new    devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the    government will be offered access to the confidential details of    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report    their findings.     The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of    encryption is dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the    privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield    criminals and terrorists.  We need the  Clipper Chip  and other    approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access    to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it    to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology    trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),    the President has directed government agencies to develop a    comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:  \t--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to \t     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;  \t--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone \t     calls and data, under proper court or other legal \t     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;  \t--   the effective and timely use of the most modern \t     technology to build the National Information \t     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and \t     the competitiveness of American industry in the global \t     marketplace; and   \t--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export \t     high technology products.     The President has directed early and frequent consultations with    affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the    privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.    \t\t\t\t   3     The Administration is committed to working with the private    sector to spur the development of a National Information    Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer    technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to    information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks    ( information superhighways ) will transmit video, images, HDTV    programming, and huge data files as easily as today is telephone    system transmits voice.     Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important    role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act    quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding    its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that    protect all Americans\' right to privacy while also protecting    them from those who break the law.     Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.     The provisions of the President is directive to acquire the new    encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.   Clipper Chip  technology provides law enforcement with \tno new authorities to access the content of the private \tconversations of Americans.     Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on \ta drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation \tencrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to \tdecipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a \tcourt order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They \twould then present documentation of this authorization to \tthe two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and \tobtain the keys for the device being used by the drug \tsmugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are \tstored separately in order to ensure the security of the key \tescrow system.     Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?     A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent \tentities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the \tAdministration have yet to determine which agencies will \toversee the key-escrow data banks.     Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure \thow strong the security is?       A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption \tsystems readily available today.  While the algorithm will \tremain classified to protect the security of the key escrow \tsystem, we are willing to invite an independent panel of \tcryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all \tpotential users that there are no unrecognized \tvulnerabilities.     Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?     A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the \tCommerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in \tthis decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the \tPresident, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet \tofficials.     Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?     A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on \tencryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify \tas we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have \tbriefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the \tdecisions related to this initiative.     Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?     A:   The government designed and developed the key access \tencryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the \tmicrocircuits to product manufacturers.  Product \tmanufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip \tmanufacturer that produces them.     Q:   Who provides the  Clipper Chip ?     A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, \tCalifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device \tmanufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed \tto other vendors in the future.     Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?      A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating \tthe  Clipper Chip  into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological \tsolution like the one proposed, would the Administration be \twilling to use legal remedies to restrict access to more \tpowerful encryption devices?     A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be \tconsidered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow \tmechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product \tthat is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive \tthan others readily available today, but it is just one \tpiece of what must be the comprehensive approach to \tencryption technology, which the Administration is \tdeveloping.  \tThe Administration is not saying,  since encryption \tthreatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, \twe will prohibit it outright  (as some countries have \teffectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that  every \tAmerican, as a matter of right, is entitled to an \tunbreakable commercial encryption product.   There is a \tfalse  tension  created in the assessment that this issue is \tan  either-or  proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be, \tand in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, \tbalanced approach such as is proposed with the  Clipper \tChip  and similar encryption techniques.     Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton \tAdministration is policy toward encryption will differ from \tthat of the Bush Administration?       A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption \ttechnology in telecommunications and computing and are \tcommitted to working with industry and public-interest \tgroups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\' \tprivacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law \tenforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime \tand terrorism.     Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use \tthe government hardware?     A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control \trequirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is \trequired to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The \tsame is true for other encryption devices.  One of the \tattractions of this technology is the protection it can give \tto U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this \tin mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a \tcase-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these \tdevices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan \tto review the possibility of permitting wider exportability \tof these products.
