Some people think it enhances the flavor.  I personally do not think it helps the taste, it makes me sick, so I try to avoid it.  > From: dyer@spdcc.com (Steve Dyer) writes:  > Sez you.

Well, I know that MSG effects ME adversely - maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that I like to try to avoid the stuff.  > From: kiran@village.com (Kiran Wagle) Writes:  > If you do not like additives, then for godsake,  > get off the net and learn to cook from scratch.  Sheesh.  EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!  Why cannot people learn to cook from scratch *ON* the net.  i have gotten LOTS of recipes off the net that do not use additives.  If you LIKE additives then get off the net and go to your local supermarket, buy lots of packaged foods, and YOU get OFF THE NET!!  > >IS IT TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT THE RECIPES ARE NOT VERY GOOD  > >OR THE FOOD IS POOR QUALITY? >  > Yes, and YOU buy it.

HEY - i shall pay *MY* hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more but does NOT have preservatives.

Well, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what is in there - reaction to Lawry is season salt - guess what is in THERE  i shall give you a hint - i have had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY different products with MSG that I figured out one thing.  UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I will not eat the stuff without my Seldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels.  > PLEASE note that I am NOT saying you are making it up, I am just > trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it > might seem.    Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products. And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge) - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST IMPORTANTLY it is enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance did not flinch when I literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg - and he always flinches when there is waste - but it was a simple explanation - I will not eat this stuff, I WON\'T cook with this stuff, so I can either throw it out or give it away.)  > From: pattee@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (Donna Pattee)  > My guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained MSG,   Probably Lawry is seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.    i am not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  i have noticed that I have a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the Chinese restaurants the day before.    > From: kelley@healthy.uwaterloo.ca (Catherine L.

But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG - some say it is more like 20% - but let us say that it is 5%.  How many people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I KNOW I have a problem with it, and I would not VOLUNTEER for a test. Like thanks guys but I do not WANT to get sick.  Also - i am sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times.  If I have a cold i am MUCH more susceptible to the reaction than when i am healthy (as proven today - when i am stuffy but for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ chips ;}).  > From: kiran@village.com (Kiran Wagle)  > Because too many of you (generic rhetorical \'you,\' not \'you Cathy\') go > around calling this  Chinese restaurant syndrome,  thus suggesting to the > people you complain to that you experience this ONLY from Chinese food.  > MSG is prevalent in a LOT more things than Chinese food--thats why I > suggested calling this  Diner syndrome.     Cathy does not - I have not saved all my postings but I NEVER called it  chinese restaurant syndrome  and I NEVER stated I got it only from Chinese food.  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or not hold) the MSG.  I cannot call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them to make me ONE back of chips without MSG.  > On the other hand, if one complains about potatoes from a mix, or > restaurant spice mixes, i am going to believe them, and if anyone says they > got (MSG-)sick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party, i am > REALLY going to believe them.
