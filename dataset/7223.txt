The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.  Two major differences in the running gear (that i am aware of) need study. My \'79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. i am not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system. The older Landcruisers have a  lock-up  type. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.  \tPaul Hovnanian\thovnania@atc.boeing.com \t[Std disclaimers apply]
