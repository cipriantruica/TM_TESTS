I do not think we have got a conspiracy on our hands, or anything vaugely similar.  I do think that the Feds showed a distinct lack of both intelligence and disregard for others safety throughout this whole mess.         I do think the FBI and the BATF screwed up big.  What made me really concerned was FBI director William Sessions being on CNN engaging in what could only be called spin control before the place had even cooled down.  Evertyhing had literally blown up in their faces and I felt there had to be something more important he should have been doing...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.
