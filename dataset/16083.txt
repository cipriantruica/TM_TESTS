I only blast people who display obvious violent intent... like black-clad men with weapons climbing thru second-story windows, or people who break down the door instead of knocking. Or people who knock my house down with tanks and set it afire.  Sound  familiar yet?  Riddle me this: Why the hell are the CONVICTED CRIMINALS in Ohio getting the kid glove treatment, and the BD is are burned alive without a trial?
