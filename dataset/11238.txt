I believe it is illegal to send any cryptographic code out of the country without an export license. (Others will correct me if this is inaccurate.)  Dunno if you had get one for the particular code you have; the only way to find out is to apply for a license.  Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send to Canada if YOU have such a license, and what is legal to send if you do not.  --  David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of                          our information, errors and omissions excepted.
