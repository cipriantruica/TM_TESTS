From: rskirsky@athena.qualcomm.com (Ray Skirsky) Subject: Re: where has Roger?  Speaking of Roger and ilk, whatever happened to good ol\' gln?  I had him in my kill file since last year is playoffs and now that i have moved to a new news reader which does not have kill files, I find that he has gone.  I must admit, however, that unlike gln, Roger seems to know something about the game as long as the subject does not touch on the Leafs.  Ray Skirsky  rskirsky@qualcomm.com
