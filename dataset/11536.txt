From: eah1@gauguin.wustl.edu (Edward Anthony Hutchins) Subject: Re: let us build software cryptophones for over the internet...  Hmmm.... CELP takes up about 12.6 MIPS for full duplex, and has been implemented on about a million DSP chips... the 56001 card in my PC only cost about $700, and i am sure once demand goes up the prices would drop. The Analog Devices 21020 board that we are looking at now cost about $500 (academic price). I do not think hardware is something to worry about... if you get it working, people will snap up internet phone cards like there was no tomorrow. What we need here is a good implementation of CELP (the government code is absolute crap, I got a 30% speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours), and modifications to pgp to allow it to compress/decompress 144 bit frames every 30msec... I think the AD21020 should have enough juice for this (50MIPS). As part of the project i am working on now, we are trying to get CELP up and running in realtime full duplex mode... I gotta find the source to pgp and see how tough it would be to integrate the en/decryption parts into the code. i shall play with it. Anyone else out there got an AD21020 setup? \t- Ed _____________________________________________________________________________ :-)  (\'\')  (-:  (,,)  :-)  (\'\')  (-:  (,,)  :-) | see lidflip instructions on Edward Hutchins, eah1@cec1.wustl.edu            | other side of card
