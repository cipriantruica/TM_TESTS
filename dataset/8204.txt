Pick a topic dear to your heart >and get the organization to act on it. Barnacles do not move ships.  you are obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted individuals, because barnacles do not each send $20 to the crew of the ship to keep it moving.   Get the organization to act on it  is easy to say, but says little about what one really can and should do.  What the organization actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors, as far as I can see.  that is what makes it so important to vote in an election of officers.  It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active (in the state and national arenas, not infighting) than other M/C organizations.  Should we change this?  Or just join the other groups that already are in politics?  (Incidentally, the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at the moment do not compare to the problems of some other groups like gun owners.  Just try to take up target pistol shooting in the Northeast or California, and I bet you shall wish you only had to worry about wearing a helmet.  (Why does every thread on rec.moto eventually come around to guns?))  -- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)
