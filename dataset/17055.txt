The KKK is allowed to    march and any attempts to curtail their freedom is rejected    (Actually I believe the ACLU won a case for them last year).  \t   Morality should not be legilated in a free country like    the U.S.   Yes. That seems to be the problem. Even Germany now has laws for its military where soldiers are *required* to disobey orders if they believe the orders are morally incorrect.  Naziism is prohibited in Canada, Germany (others?). How pray tell is Canda any less free than the US?  \t   i shall post something on TJ and Uva under Uva for those    Hoos bashers.  Harry.
