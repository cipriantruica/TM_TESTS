From: jsw@icf.hrb.com (Jeffrey S. Weber) Subject: XView, SUN XGL, performance problem   i have written an application for SparcStation 2 GX+, under OpenWindows 3.0.  The application uses XView stuff to create my window, and the SUN XGL graphics library for rendering into the Canvas.  The application does real-time 2-D animation, but it does not update the the display fast enough. i am using notify_set_itimer (XView call) to periodically kick off my update routine, and it is not happening fast enough. I want it to update 25 times / second. it is only doing about 11. Also, it appears to be compute bound, because if I run anything else while my appplication is up, the update rate slows down even more.  Any ideas ? Thanks.
