I did not suggest that all  government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I do not follow the  comments above.  >>  >>  >:Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only  feasible  approach.

Do you mean that >[] are impossible in priciple,  or merely that it would be undesirable in >fact?  I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.  Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort. > > >:Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as  >:generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense. >:(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to >:be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending >:that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...) > >You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence >of libertarian philosophy.

I just think it is interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be  counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.) > >>  >:Perhaps you have.

But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8), i am willing to justify such programs on that basis. > > >\tI do not want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring >under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably >intelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions. >I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be >ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.

I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not the case that  any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.   There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one example.  jsh  >Mr. Grinch -- Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM     One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh  the bulls**t.  - R.
