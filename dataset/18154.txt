Local media has not said much, if anything, about the MOW.  Also, when I called a straight friend in Arlington to tell him I would be on his doorstep this weekend, he did not know anything at all about the march. This is a gay-sympathetic person who notices things like this.  I thought it was strange that he was unaware of what was happening.  It made me wonder just how much coverage is getting to  mainstream  America.  --  Scott Amspoker                       |  Head like a hole, black as your soul.
