A friend of mine worked for an electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. They routinely sold equipment to the Japanese. One day, the Japanese started showing up with discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the products.  This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field  offices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computer systems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data out double-block-encrypted with DES.   Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to  knock it off . The president gave in, since his company did a considerable business with the federal government.  Now, if the government was not monitoring the communications, how would they even know that the encryption system was installed? Further, since encryp- tion is not illegal, and DES certainly is not, what is the basis of the government is cease-and-desist demand?  The spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessings of the law. i shall say  no thanks  to Clipper, or anything else the government produces. For the moment, double or triple DES is probably adequate. And when the line is idle, send random garbage, just to keep \'em busy.       David Hayes    merlin@lerami.lerctr.org
