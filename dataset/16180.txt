As we have seen here in the US, there is nothing irrational about it.  Perhaps you folks in Finland have been down on your knees being good little boys and girls so that the former Soviet Union did not come across the border and stomp the snot out of you for so long that you just figure everybody should be so accomodating to tyranny.   >  > \t2.

I could not care less about what somebody on the other side of the world thinks  about this. Of course, you do have a right to an opinion...  but i have always figured that opinons are like hemmorhoids.
