The     publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to     space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in     Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to     the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second     edition of the guide.      The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job     opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of      Space Jobs  features strategies for entering the space field and     describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and     non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate     schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing     to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an     astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia, as     well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON      Official names are decided by committees of the International     Astronomical Union, and are not for sale. There are purely commercial     organizations which will, for a fee, send you pretty certificates and     star maps describing where to find  your  star. These organizations have     absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they     assign are not used by anyone else. it is also likely that you will not be     able to see  your  star without binoculars or a telescope.

Bussard, Journal of \tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990  \t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion \t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the \t    thrust-power  gain  G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values \t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are \t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these,  high-thrust  \t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system \t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local \t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100 \t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer \t     high-thrust  flight capability. One performance example shows a \t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with \t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows \t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in \t    Earth/moon space.  \t The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for \tAerospace Flight Propulsion  by Robert W. Bussard, EMC2-1190-03, \tavailable from Energy/Matter Conversion Corp., 9100 A. Center \tStreet, Manassas, VA 22110.  \t    [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard is version \t    of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion \t    technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch \t    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in \t    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising \t    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the \t    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim \t    Bowery]  \t PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications , by \tPaul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion \tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.  \t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron \t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times \t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma \t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds \t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities \t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and \t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm \t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure \t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically \t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power \t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens \t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the \t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages \t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I \t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob \t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently \t    declared Koloc is PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one \t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather \t    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the \t    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid \t    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:  \tRetrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE \tarchive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the \tSERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in \tthe 1960s and 70s.
