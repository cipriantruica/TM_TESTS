So although you do not agree with the fatwa, and apparently do not think Rushdie should be killed for his book, yet you think he is not due sympathy for being being under this threat.  Furthermore you base this reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular well-known story which -- if true -- might reflect poorly on the absolute truth of your religion.  Yet, this opinion is formed without recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context, accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this book contains and what the author is motivations are.  And then you come forward and recommend another book which touches on (presumably  plays with ) religious/historical material because you find its overall presentation neutral! --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.
