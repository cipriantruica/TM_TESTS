Sure, there are oddball >latched memory chips, but do you really want to use them?  >Sorry if i am pedantic but: design your circuit using >reasonably available parts, and move on to more important >problems.  we are looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series. They have _mega_ address decoding logic on them, various ROM sizes (upto 1Mbit), various RAM sizes (upto 16 K), and 19 I/O ports which can be chip select lines, I/O or the buffered address lines.  Cute chip, 44 pin PLCC package.  Second sourcing may be a problem though :-(   Bryan Ryan, VK3TKX Melbourne, Australia bryan@philips.oz.au
