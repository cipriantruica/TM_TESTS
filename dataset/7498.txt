As for the Bugatti, well, I have to agree >with Matt, it am not the top dog, it am not sexy and svelt-looking, and it >am not a real Bugatti.  In fact, it looks like it is in tight competition >with the Consulier for the most butt-ugly car of the decade award.  It is not that bad.  At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves compared to the slab sides on the Consulier.  And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V-12 (thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together).  Also Ettore Bugatti is nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the development.  So that is about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in today is world.  Much like Enzo Ferrari is illegitamate son being allowed to take over part of Ferrari as well...   >I do not know of any cars with v4, but there are a number of motorcycles >with them - but I could not tell you which ones, all motorcycles look alike >to me.   :D  that is funny.  I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about `cages\'.  :-)  Most GP 500cc motorcycles are V-4s, and the VF line of Hondas were all V-4s (from the VF-400F through the VF-1000F, including the RC30 race bike and the present VFR-750F).  It should be noted that Lancia built a V-4 in recent history in the Fulvia HF, a very pretty Italian coupe.   --  Al Bowers  DOD    Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  \'blad  Iaido  NASA  Well goodness sakes...do not you know that girls cannot play guitar?                                               -Mary Chapin-Carpenter
