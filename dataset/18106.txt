Proving once again that Brett has a major thinking problem...  Two groups that the government insure are the elderly and the  medically an needy  (those who have impoverished themselves through spending for medical care).  The typical elderly person spends 3.5 times what a person under age 65.  The typical medically needy person spends about 10 times what the average person does.  you have got to adjust those data, Brett.
