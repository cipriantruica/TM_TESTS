From: Patrick Walker  Subject: Did you really expect Toronto to go anywhere?  REALLY!  Detroit is a very disciplined team.  there is a lot of Europeans in Detroit which would make the game fast, so Toronto would have to slow the game down, which means drawing penalties, as a last resort anyway.  Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players.  Toronto is just an average team, Detroit is not Ballard screwed Toronto when he was owner.  Everyone knows that. and it is going to take time for Toronto to become a real force. I expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year.  He cannot pull the whole team forever.
