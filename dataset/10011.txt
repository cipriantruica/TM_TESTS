From: gp2011@andy.bgsu.edu (George Pavlic) Subject: Re: Ron Francis  Not to mention, Mr. Francis is an incredibly nice person.  Over Christmas break, a friend of mine had a little Xmas gathering.  The two of us drove to Ron is house.  While I stayed in the car out of shyness, my friend went to the door and rang the bell.  Ron answered and my friend introduced himself.  He then proceeded to invite Francis to the party.  Ron declined because he  had to watch his daughter.   He then reached out and shook my friend is hand!  I know this is not r.s.b., but I do not think Barry Bonds would be this polite in this situation.  George
