This is precisely NOT what you said.  Among others, see Olney is   Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of Animal Studies to Human Safety  (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol. vol 6: 455-462.  i am sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.  >>Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well.

You know, studies of >glutamate involve more than  food science .  Whose talking about  food science ? What is this comment supposed to mean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*, *Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)  >>Pardon me, but where are you getting this from?

Then you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to  Chinese Restaurant Syndrome  in a few articles. Why do not *you* point us to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.  >>The point is exceeding the window.

Who said anything about \'received wisdom\'? There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary, ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone?   How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? it is unethical to  sacrifice  humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food industry knows this. that is why the animal model is used in medicine and psych.  If you are talking about straight sensitivity, it would be useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology.  I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me).  Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their hidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels* attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.   >>Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you >>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles >>disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever.  > >You mean  asserting .  you are being intellectually dishonest (or just >plain confused), because you are conflating reports which do not necessarily >have anything to do with each other.

It says nothing about MSG is contribtion to the phenomenon >of the  Chinese Restaurant Syndrome .

Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development, but also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of headaches? I do not know.  >>>dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com  >>Hmm.  .com . Why am I not surprised? >>- Dianne Murray   wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca > >Probably one of the dumber remarks you have made.
