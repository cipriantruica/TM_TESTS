From: sat@eng.tridom.com (Stephen Thomas) Subject: Mouse Jumpiness Solved!  cannot guarantee that it shall work for everyone, but I finally fixed my mouse jumpiness problems: I installed a bus mouse. (Sorry, I did not say the solution was free.) In the past i had tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse. (Cleaning it, unloading all kinds of TSRs, turning off SMARTDRV write cacheing, changing COM ports, ...) Nothing worked. Yesterday I finally broke down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse. The improvement is even better than I had imagined! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so used to it I did not notice. My wife, who uses the computer about once a month, noticed the improvement literally within a second!  I cannot say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems one you shall have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you do not know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.  Hope this helps someone else. If you are anywhere near as frustrated as I was, it is well worth the $80.  ---  Stephen Thomas   AT&T Tridom   (404-514-3522) email: sat@eng.tridom.com, attmail!tridom!sat
