From: rlglende@netcom.com (Robert Lewis Glendenning) Subject: Re: Do we need the clipper for cheap security?  There are chips which perform the voice compression/expansion.  They cannot be expensive, because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the PBX line cards, as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses voice-grade circuits to save the cost of long-distance, leased T1s or satellite circuits.  I cannot remember the generic term for these chips.  My impression is that this was a big deal 10 years ago, but circuits have gotten so cheap that it is not done much now.
