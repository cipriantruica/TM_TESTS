I AGREE, LUMBERJACK (except that they are in 2nd)!  They ARE going PLACES - San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Cincinnati, Denver, Atlanta, Miami, Philadelphia, New York, Montreal, Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis...and points in between.  :-)  But, THEY\'RE 0-3 AT HOME!  i am just not used to an overly enthusiastic Houston fan.  I really should not discourage it, so HANG IN THERE, LUMBERJACK!  (But, get ahold of that shift key, will ya?)  ObBase:  Apparently the new owner (Drayton McLain (sp?)) does not particularly like excuses.  An item in our paper (the Austin American-Statesman -  If you read it here, it was somewhere else first ) said that he would not take  injuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been accounted for.  Uh, oh.  I do not want an owner that\'ll keep everybody on edge - i had never gotten that feeling about him, but who knows?  Does  anybody down there in the Houston area have a feel for how meddling of an owner McLain is going to be? --  Marc Stephenson\t           IBM AWS (Advanced Workstations & Systems - Austin,TX) DISCLAIMER: The content of this posting is independent of official IBM position.
