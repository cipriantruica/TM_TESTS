Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by   mid-season. C\'mon, the Phillies have not proved anything yet. Atlanta   was similar to the Phils 2 years ago. They sucked. They started having   a good year, but did not get any respect until they actually won the   division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST      have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they will not get any respect   either. BTW, Atlanta is .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good   the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils   record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta is hitting will   improve dramatically.     No, i am not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team.    Orin.
