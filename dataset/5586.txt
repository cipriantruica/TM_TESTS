(Not tree views)  \tFreeware, shareware, comercial... \tLike this, for instance:                                                                                           O                           |                           |                 O---------O=======>O                /          |               /           |         O----O.....O      O             /              /                O     O  \t* Just by giving the associations  \t  between the nodes. Automatic \t  layout generation.  \t* It would be nice if any node  \t  symbols could be used. Maybe  \t  even to insert widgets as nodes.  \t* Using different line styles etc. \t  for describing associations.  \tAny information would be appreciated, \tthanks in advance,  \t\t\tJorgen (Jorgen.Eriksson@eua.ericsson.se)
