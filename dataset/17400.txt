From: dbernste@hugo.prime.com (David Bernstein) Subject: nobody knows his name           I do not mean to sound disrespectful, but since the majority of the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem to be muslims, christians and jews, my question could be of some  interest to any of them.         it is my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay great respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from Judea/Galilee. Why  they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery to me (personally, I prefer Woody Allen - his stories are much juicier) - but perhaps it is an accident of history.         Anyway, it seems that they may be talking about two different jews. According to the New Testament his father is name was Joseph, while in Qur\'an he appears as Zachariah.           who has right and why the name difference? i am really curious.                 David.
