Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical, biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.  Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation,  bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.   CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe it is a continuum. I do not know.  =================================  Howard Doyle doyle+@pitt.edu
