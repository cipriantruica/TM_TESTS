It is a weapons grade poison. \tWould I be breaking the law then if I were to, say, pour Chlorox \ton the spot where my cat pissed on the floor?  The reaction of \tammonia and bleach liberates pure chlorine gas.  Do I go to jail \tfor this?  Why or why not?  \tWould I need a license to possess other chemical agents?  What about \tnicotine?  Deadly poison, and rather fast acting.  Must I now become \tlicensed to posess tobacco?  And what about nicotine sulphate, an even \tdeadlier poison?  Will I need a license to possess this type of  \tinsecticide?  What about Raid(tm)?  Black Flag?  Gasoline?  Benzene? \tHydrazine (a violent poison)?  \tWill I go to jail for possessing a can of tomatoes that went bad with \tbotulinus?  \tWhat about my mom & pop QC lab where I use cyanogen bromide (mustard \tgas) to do lot analysis on certain non-prescription pharmaceuticals?  \tWhat if I wish to use potassium cyanide to recover gold from aqua \tregia?  A license?   \tWould I need a license to possess Beryllium, perhaps the most poisonous \tnon-radioactive metal?  How about Beryllium-Copper alloy?  \tDo I need a license for nitrate fertilizers which *could* be used to \tmake VERY powerful explosive devices such as the one that the IRA \trecently detonated, killing 1 and injuring 45?  \tCan I have vinegar without license?  Hydrogen peroxide?  Where is the  \tline drawn?      >I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for  >definitions.  \tYes they could, but are they good ideas?  Are they needed?
