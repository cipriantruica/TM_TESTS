If you do not want to have a wedding in a church, do not. If you want to call that a marriage, go right ahead.  I hope that the young people that are around you, do not follow your example.   |-------------------| | Gary Chin         | | Staff Engineer    | | Sun Microsystems  | | Mt.

Various aspects of marriage are discussed in some of Paul is letters, Ephesians 5 sees marriage as a symbol of God is relationship with the church.  If it means specifically that the marriage ceremony is not described, then that seems to be true.  But I think what most people mean by Christian marriage is not so much that it takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the various commitments to each other that are associated with marriage in the Bible.  --clh]
