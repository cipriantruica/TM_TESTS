I was at that game, behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the  radar gun.  The 1991 season was winding down and Roger did not have his  best fastball, topping out at 88-90 (in contrast to Frank Tanana, who went  as low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out Phil  Plantier *five* times on the night).  Inky is shot would have gone further than any i have ever seen if it had not crashed *into* the lights (not the  lightstand) as you say over 100 feet high, Roy Hobbs-like, and bounced  back onto the field.  That had to have been a 525-footer if unobstructed, edging out Bo Jackson is drive off Oil Can Boyd to the top of the centerfield bleacher back wall in 1988 for the best i have seen personally  (I was sitting under that one).   --- Glenn Waugaman Digital Equipment Corporation Littleton, MA g_waugaman@nac.enet.dec.com ---
