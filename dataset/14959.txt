I disagree.  People marry each other.  When they commit fully to each other as life partners, they are married.  The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing. God knows our hearts.  He knows when two have committed themselves to be one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully giving ourselves to another.  The way I see it, you had have to be living together in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyone knew if a marriage really existed, but God knows.  I do not think God keeps a scorebook.  Joe Moore
