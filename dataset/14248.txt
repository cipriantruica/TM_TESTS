Indeed, the sky does not look much like a black body if you look carefully enough; in particular, its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a bit higher than you would see from a black body.  Morgan&Gordon is fat  Communications Satellite Handbook  has a graph of sky temperature vs. wavelength, in fact, for communications design.  However, in terms of energy content, the RF frequencies are negligible. For thermal purposes, at very large distances from the Sun the sky looks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen,  Astrophysical Quantities ). I have not found a number for non-large distances, since solar radiation tends to be something you cannot just ignore :-), but M&G says  about 4K  in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem. --  SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
