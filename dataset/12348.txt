Um...  1) Your Professor if just plain wrong.  Although blue LEDs are one heck of a lot less efficient than red ones. 2)  Typical visible light LEDs  do not really exist.  LEDs have a fairly narrow region of transmittence.  (Since the Fermi energy around either side of the band gap falls off exponentially, blah, blah...)  >Source: Solid State Electronic Devices (Ben G.

Cree Research makes them (probably along with other companies...  Cree is big in materials science, though; they advertise in the stuff like Physics Today, etc.).  You can buy them from JameCo (I think), DigiKey (definitely), and plenty of other distributors.  Actually, these days you _can_ get a  typical visible light  LED -- it is called a  rainbow LED , and i have forgotten who makes it (they advertise in EDN and many of the other trade rags, though).  It combines a reg, green, and blue LED all on one chip (and has four leads).  Nifty device, although it is probably fairly expensive.  \t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad
