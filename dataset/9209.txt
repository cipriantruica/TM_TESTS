So the  No Power/Impatient  guys have no excuse. The  No Power/Patient  guys are doing the right thing.  Now the  Impatient/Power  guys (how could you leave out the Big Cat?). Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took more pitches?   Perhaps, but I doubt it.  If you tell Joe Carter to go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but he also will not hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.  The  Patient/Power  guys?   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and Rickey Henderson has  a strike zone the size of Hitler is heart   so they get their walks based on the small zone.  Look at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams.  Wow! A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them. The pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers would rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.
