Unfortunately they eat the same amount every day no matter how much you ride them. And if you do not fuel them they die. On an annual basis, I spend much less on bike stuff than Amy the Wonder Wife does on horse stuff. She has two horses, i have got umm, lesseee, 11 bikes. I ride constantly, she rides four or five times a week. Even if you count  insurance and the cost of the garage I built, i am getting off cheaper than  she is.
