From: mvalente@draco.lnec.pt (mvalente) Subject: None (mail relay)        Hi people!:     i am looking for X Servers for DOS or Windows.    i have already seen Desqview/X and XVision but i had like to be  aware of other choices.    Is there anything on the public domain or shareware ?    And in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive  pricing ?    What about incompatibilities ? Window managers ?    Any info is welcome.      Thanx in advance.     C U!     By(e)       Mario Valente
