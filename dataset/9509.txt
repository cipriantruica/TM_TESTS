I heard he was >completely recovered, but now i am not so sure.  You must have heard wrong.  His arm is still sore.  He has not gone on the DL, but he may.  Managmenet is treating him as a day-to-day situation.    His doctors thought that he was ready, and they had him throw in Colorado, but his arm was not up to the strain.  He is throwing every day, but he has just not quite ready to pitch full strength yet.  (This is based on an interview that he gave on WFAN NY radio on Thursday, 4/23) --  Jon Lyons                                            jon.k.lyons@att.com AT&T Bell Laboratories                               att!jon.k.lyons
